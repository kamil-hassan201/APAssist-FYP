As so, the cluster is at the beginning of the code to ensure there are no duplicate codes created in GIMS.\nWhy haven't we added the intakes to the class code?, Academic_Administration, It seems like you're discussing the structure of class codes and the challenges associated with incorporating intakes into the class code. Here are some considerations and a revised example: Unique Class Codes: It's important that class codes are unique, especially when used across different systems, to avoid confusion. However, as you pointed out, when intakes change, it may lead to changes in the class codes. One possible approach is to include a timestamp or academic year/semester to ensure uniqueness without altering the code too frequently. Short and Manageable Class Codes: Class codes should be short and manageable, especially for modules with a high number of intakes. One way to achieve this is to use abbreviations or acronyms for module names and include intake-related information as a suffix. Here's a revised example using your provided data: Original Intakes: APU2102SE APU2102CT Original Class Code: APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14 Revised Class Codes for Separated Intakes (Week 3 or 4): APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14___CT APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14___SE By including intake information as a suffix, you can distinguish between different intakes while maintaining a stable base class code. The inclusion of the academic year and semester also ensures uniqueness. For the second part of your question, it appears you want to reformat a list of intakes and module codes in a more readable way.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "32fd3df1-3bd3-4063-b624-b8a560d82321": {"__data__": {"id_": "32fd3df1-3bd3-4063-b624-b8a560d82321", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "23ef04ba-fd5c-45cc-9f62-2e062d76c9b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6fcfa0f844023827e4c52dfe59b5535ecd89480ec040159329da4d135a0b41d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3a2a669-a3ee-493e-b480-6ea1c3c3422c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2f9e820e01f30de2b1426f56922c865f9901ab408612829e55f01f8cdadd43d"}}, "hash": "6ea9a7e86f1cab241a6e45817f6ca28ca6116a49d563973c320bb5216c067d74", "text": "Here's the reformatted list: Intakes: UC2F2102BM APD1F2103CE APD1F2103CGD APD1F2103CS APD1F2103CS(CYB) APD1F2103CS(DF) APD1F2103CS(IS) APD1F2103EEE APD1F2103IT APD1F2103ME APD1F2103MMT APD1F2103PE APD1F2103SE APU1F2103CE APU1F2103CGD APU1F2103CS APU1F2103CS(CYB) APU1F2103CS(DF) APU1F2103CS(IS) APU1F2103EEE APU1F2103IT APU1F2103ME APU1F2103MMT APU1F2103PE APU1F2103SE APU1F2103ACS APD1F2103ACS APU1F2103AF APD1F2103AF APU1F2103BAF APD1F2103BAF APU1F2103BAF(FT) APD1F2103BAF(FT) APU1F2103BM APD1F2103BM APU1F2103HRM APU1F2103IBM APD1F2103IBM APU1F2103MKT APD1F2103MKT APU1F2103TRM APD1F2103TRM APU1F2103IR APD1F2103IR APU1F2103MCS APD1F2103MCS APD1F2103TE APU1F2103TE APD1F2103ME Module Code: MPU3173-MLY3(FS)-L-2 I hope this formatting is clearer and more readable for your needs.\nWould I like to request a letter that says I am APU student?, Academic_Administration, Please write to APU Admin Frontliner fliners@apu.edu.my to request for the reference letter.

The claims for extenuating circumstances with supporting evidence must be submitted no more than 3 working days after the extenuating circumstances occurred.\nHow do I submit EC?, Academic_Administration, You can submit EC Online from the following link \u2013 e-Forms (Forms & Applications). APSpace > More > e-Forms. The claims for extenuating circumstances with supporting evidence must be submitted no more than 3 working days after the extenuating circumstances occurred. Fill up the information needed and click \u2018Submit\u2019. You are only required to print the hardcopy and submit the EC Form together with your supporting document to Submission Counter Level 4 @ APU New Campus when the university requires a hard copy of your supporting document. Note: You are required to keep the original copy of all submitted materials. Below is the guide to submit EC (Extenuating Circumstances) application using e-Forms platform. Step 1 Go to your web browser and enter or click the following URL \u2013 http://forms.sites.apiit.edu.my/. You can access e-Forms platform from your APSpace; APSpace > More > e-Forms (Forms & Applications). Step 2 Login with your APKey credentials and you will get a list of e-forms. Select EC Submission from the list of forms. Step 3 The EC Submission form is divided into four (4) sections \u2013 Section A: Personal Details, Section B: Types of Circumstances and Module(s) Affected, Section C: Extenuating Circumstances Details and Section D: Student Declaration. In the first section (Section A), you have to provide required personal details which are already auto filled. You may have to change your Intake Code from the drop down. Step 4 In the section B, you have to provide details of type of activity affected for each module. Depending on the activity affected you have to provide relevant details. You can submit EC for only twelve (12) modules per e-form. If you have more depending lecture/tutorial of module then you need to submit another form. Step 5 In the section C, you have to provide description of your circumstance and provide supporting document(s). If you have more than one supporting documents then, CTRL + select. You have to upload your supporting document(s) in format; .pdf, .jpg, .png, docx, or .doc. If you uploaded incorrect file then, you can click on \u2297 to remove that file. Step 6 In this last section D, student needs to confirm with EC Submission terms of services and click submit.

You can get details of each module EC Application submitted.\nWhat else do I need to do submit EC?, Academic_Administration, It is your responsibility to supply the appropriate evidence to support your claim. Supporting documents/evidences that are in a language other than English or Bahasa Melayu must be accompanied by a certified translation of the original documents. Where your EC concerns sickness, a medical certificate/full medical report from a registered medical practitioner from clinic or  Government Hospital will be required. You should not submit a claim where a single seminar, lecture or lab work has been missed due to  illness. If you join an award part-way through the semester, late entry will not be viewed as an extenuating circumstance. This would not be considered to be an appropriate basis upon which to submit a claim   for extenuating circumstances.\nWhat are the documents needed to support my EC?, Academic_Administration, All requests for consideration of extenuating circumstances must typically be substantiated with relevant and independent documentary evidence. The evidence required for various unforeseen circumstances is as follows: Illness: Medical Certificate or a Letter from a registered medical practitioner from a private or government clinic/hospital. Death in the Family: Death Certificate. Accident/Robbery: Police Report. Visa Issues: Flight tickets and visa documents. Applications for extenuating circumstances are further reinforced when accompanied by endorsements from University staff members such as Academic Mentors, Programme Leaders, or Lecturers. It is important to note that self-certification of your own circumstances or evidence not provided by an independent authority will not be accepted by the University.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "baf04af8-b256-4587-b406-7697903e8708": {"__data__": {"id_": "baf04af8-b256-4587-b406-7697903e8708", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "08009c0a-ad34-4aca-a81c-71e891329522", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "419c8678a75dbfc14877a2ab67d46bcec9179bbe04eff260a64d7da9ce4ed6a5"}, "3": {"node_id": "1218af73-1b8f-44d7-85d2-dcdd8cd32951", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "865dbe1eba578e10fa268f64b0854714ce93528513180d0c86111ba46a3c7f43"}}, "hash": "f261afc1ca8a1835875e09ffffbbad079bb48263e9d7a1790dbb1307a5c878fb", "text": "What grounds will not normally be considered as extenuating circumstances?, Academic_Administration, You may not normally claim extenuating circumstances on the basis that your academic performance has been affected by family, financial or other lifestyle problems. In particular, extenuating circumstances cannot normally be claimed on any of the following grounds (the list is not exhaustive): Normally, the second or subsequent attempt of an element of assessment (exam or coursework) where an EC has   been upheld for a previous attempt Inadequate planning, organisation or management on your part, this may include: Development of a solution taking longer than anticipated Learning a programming language taking longer than anticipated Technical difficulties in integrating elements of a solution, etc Timetabling of coursework or examinations Misreading of assessment dates and times Personal computer or printer problems Minor illnesses, such as a cold Holidays or social occasions Transport problems Moving house Normal work patterns and pressures of employment Pregnancy (unless unexpected complications occur) If you are uncertain whether your claim might be legitimate, please discuss this with your Academic Mentor or  your Programme Leader. Any student who is alleged to have submitted falsified evidence in support of a claim of extenuating circumstances will be referred for consideration under the terms of the APU/APIIT Academic Dishonesty Regulations.\nWhat should I include when I explain my circumstances?, Academic_Administration, The circumstances must have been at the same time as the acquisition of the skill/knowledge/competency or the assessment of the module. If you have missed an assignment through ill health, then the illness must coincide   with the preparation, writing or deadline of that assessment. If you are a part-time student and have been unable to submit your work by the original deadline date because, for instance, you were required by your employer to work away from home for several weeks at the time you should have submitted your work, you must provide a letter from your employer confirming this. The circumstances should be detailed concisely. The Extenuating Circumstances Claims Office should be provided with the essential information to enable it to make an informed decision regarding the circumstances.\nWhich kind supporting evidance I have to submit during my illness?, Academic_Administration, Please note that minor illnesses or ailments will not normally be accepted as valid reasons for extenuating circumstances. Unless you have seen a Doctor or Counsellor at the time of your illness or problem, it is unlikely that your claim will be accepted. For instance, a letter from a Specialist Medical Centre or Government Hospital stating that you were seen on a particular date and told him/her that you HAD BEEN ill will not normally be accepted.\nWhat if I have no evidence?, Academic_Administration, A claim is unlikely to be upheld without appropriate supporting evidence. You should review the circumstances   and try to find an independent person, organization or support service that can provide verification. A member of staff may be able to provide a supporting statement.\nWho will consider my claim?, Academic_Administration, The Office of Extenuating Circumstances Claims will liaise with School(s) responsible for the programme to which the claim relates. The claim submitted is reviewed individually and confidentially. The Office decides whether to uphold your claim or not and will inform you via the online system, of its decision.\nIf I submit a claim for extenuating circumstances when do I have to hand in my work?, Academic_Administration, Where a claim for extenuating circumstances on assessment has been submitted, you must continue to complete the assessment work (e.g. incourse with a predetermined deadline, Investigation Report, Final Year Project report) and submit it as soon as it is completed while waiting for the decision of the extenuating circumstances claim. The Office of Extenuating Circumstances Claims will take account of the timing of your extenuating circumstances and the original submission date. The final decision of the new submission date will be made by the Office if the claim is upheld.\nHow to fix Intake Codes not appearing in Extenuating Circumstance (EC)?, Academic_Administration, Problem: While completing your Extenuating Circumstances (EC) application, you may encounter a rare issue that can be attributed to your web browser.

Failing to provide evidence will result in the rejection of your claim. Failure of Network Connection: In the case of network connectivity issues affecting your work during assessment submissions (examinations or assignments), you must provide evidence of the network issue, including a timestamp and screen shots. This should be accompanied by any related communication with the lecturer or invigilation staff. Failure to provide this evidence will lead to claim rejection. Failure to Provide Appropriate Software: If you choose to work on an individual project with specific software requirements, it is your responsibility to ensure that this software is available before starting the project. Problems arising from software compatibility or availability will not be accepted as valid extenuating circumstances due to a lack of planning. Insufficient Computers in the Lab: If there are insufficient computers for the class size, the lecturer should take appropriate action, and this issue may be considered in the module assessment. Failure Affecting a Large Number of Systems at Assignment Deadline: If a significant number of computers are unavailable for an extended period, a short extension to the assignment deadline may be considered. You should have the Technical Assistant countersign your extenuating circumstances claim. Theft of Home Computer or Laptop: Students are expected to maintain backup copies of their work on a separate device. Claims based on theft without appropriate backup will not be upheld. Insufficient Computers/Printers: Claims based on the unavailability of computers or printers will not be supported, as they suggest inadequate planning. Incompatibility with APU/APIIT's Systems: Students should ensure that work from home can be presented or printed at APU/APIIT well in advance of assessment deadlines. Claims based on system incompatibility will not be upheld. Computer Failure Preventing Saving Work: Claims related to computer failure should be accompanied by the submission of the latest draft of your work. Early Closure of Computer Labs: Claims based on labs closing earlier than expected will not be supported, as they indicate a lack of advanced planning. Failure of Backup Device: Claims based on backup device failure are rarely upheld. Students are expected to have secure backup copies of their work. If a backup device fails, the latest draft of the work must be submitted by the regular hand-in date. Failure of Both Main Disk and Backup Device: If both main disk and backup device failures occur due to system issues, it may be considered, provided APU/APIIT Technical Services staff can confirm the incident. Students are expected to submit the latest draft of their work. In summary, it's essential to plan ahead and take necessary precautions to ensure the safety and accessibility of your work in case of IT equipment failure.

Using CAS, you can act as an OpenID Connect Provider (OP), authenticating users using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, or as a relying party (RP) that requests user authorization from an OP.\nTerminology\n\nAccess token A credential that is used to access protected resources. An access token is a string, and represents an authorization that is issued to the client. Authorization Endpoint A resource on an OpenID Provider that accepts an authorization request from a client to perform authentication and authorization on a user. The authorization endpoint returns an authorization grant (or code) to the client in the Basic Client Profile. In the Implicit Client Profile, the authorization endpoint returns an ID token and access token to the client. The authorization grant is a credential that represents a user\u2019s authorization to access resources. This credential is used by a client to obtain an access token. Claim Information that is asserted about an entity. Examples of a claim include a phone number, given name, or surname.ID token A JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the authenticated user.Introspection EndpointA resource on an OpenID Provider that enables a client that holds an access token to retrieve information. The information is used to create the access token (such as the user name, granted scopes, or client ID).OpenID Provider (OP) An OAuth 2.0 authorization server that can provide claims to a client, or Relying Party (RP). Refresh TokenA token that is issued to the client by the OP. The token is used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires or to obtain more access tokens. Relying Party (RP)Either a WebSphere Application Server configured as an OpenID Connect Client, or a client application that requires claims from an OpenID Provider (OP).", "start_char_idx": null,

IT_Helpdesk, The CAS (Central Authentication Service) login service allows you to access multiple computing systems after entering your username and password only once on a central authentication server. This is often referred to as single sign-on. For example, if you log in to PAWS, you will be able to access services such as Blackboard or wikis without having to log in again.\n\nCAS currently supports several web applications. In the future, all other systems will use CAS as well.\n\nYou will be automatically redirected to the CAS login screen when you access one of the supported systems, unless you have already authenticated to CAS during your session. You can also reach the CAS login screen directly at https://cas.apiit.edu.my/cas/login.\n\nCAS currently supports two types of authentication: REST, and Direct. CAS clients can be deployed on a combination of platforms including Windows, Linux, and both Apache and IIS. CAS supports a variety of tools and languages.\n\nWhile CAS authentication will only return a username, you can use that username to query ADS and retrieve more information.\nInformation about integrating CAS with a website, IT_Helpdesk, There are several different ways for applications to integrate CAS authentication, including login and validation.\nWhen integrating CAS authentication with your application, follow these best practices:\nApplications using CAS must operate entirely over TLS (i.e., the cas url must be an HTTPS URL).\nEnabling HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is highly recommended.\nTo be sure they are authenticating to APIIT Education Group\u2019s CAS, users must be able to see the URL https://cas.apiit.edu.my/cas/login.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc7ca592-1181-4815-acc1-cc90daf4acd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc7ca592-1181-4815-acc1-cc90daf4acd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "7f5d9196-97d0-4610-8cfa-af1be6235c05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "df538042e89bff39be5e0bf5c78412b1e62fe464acc9335061eddd7db9f46589"}, "3": {"node_id": "2cb6418c-6a14-4c44-95e6-ba46feffc045", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "aabd4697ad804346af5249bef610cc1da69501a5f7b3172ce2834dc1d30a6127"}}, "hash": "b9cb35349772817c137590d65b942a39647851cbf8a87fb4cac8f3e07038f6cd", "text": "Therefore, applications must redirect to CAS and not render the login page inside an iframe or use other similar techniques.\nUser accounts login problem in CAS, IT_Helpdesk, There have been multiple cases where provided the credential to CAS was correct but authentication fails.

This guide helps you to understand what you can and cannot do with resubmissions.\n\nTurnitin allows you to resubmit 3 times, and then you must wait 24 hours. \n\nIf you make a resubmission, you will see this message:\n\nYou have already submitted a paper to this assignment and a Similarity Report was generated for your submission. If you choose to resubmit your paper, your earlier submission will be replaced and a new report will be generated. After three resubmissions, you will need to wait 24 hours after a resubmission to see a new Similarity Report.\n\nThis policy is set by Turnitin. Moodle Support is not able to override this or make reports generate faster. \n\nInstructors are advised not to submit request to delete submissions to make multiple re-submissions with an assumption that this action will generate the Similarity Report quicker. Turnitin Support will not entertain deletion requests of this nature.\n\nThis does not mean that your submission will be considered late, even if the report is still pending after the due date. The time and date shown in the submitted column is considered your official submission time. Your tutors will understand that sometimes the report will take longer.\n\nPlease only contact us if the report has taken longer than 24 hours to appear.  Open a ticket with ITHelpdesk  via Virtual Help Centre or go to APSpace > More > Help Centre, and mention the name of the Course Code where you submitted it and link of Moodle Course Folder, and the Paper ID.\nAcademic Integrity Statement, IT_Helpdesk, By submitting this assessment, I declare that this work is entirely my own, except those parts duly identified and referenced in my submission.\n\nIn the case of group work, we declare that this work is entirely the work of the group members, except those parts duly identified and referenced in our submission.\n\nIt complies with:\n\n    Any specified word limits and\n\n    The requirements and regulations detailed in the assignment instructions and\n\n    Any other relevant program and module documentation.\n\nIn submitting this work, I acknowledge that I have read and understood the regulations and code regarding academic integrity, including that relating to plagiarism, as specified in the Programme Handbook.

This is useful for evaluating work such as papers you are collecting in print, classroom presentations, performances, or lab experiments. The activity can be graded in Moodle and the due date will appear in the Calendar block.\nAssessment Overview, IT_Helpdesk, Assessment and feedback are at the heart of the student experience, shaping students\u2019 understanding of the curriculum, and influencing student progress on the programme and career choices. The assessment also forms a significant part of the workload for academics and administrators and yet is an area that is often rated unsatisfactory by students. (JISC, 2010)\n\nWhen setting assessment deadlines online, we recommend that deadlines are set between 9-5 Monday-Friday to ensure educational technology, technology, and course office support is available for students who experience problems with their online assessment. Review the Module Page Checklist: Assessment Information on Module Page for requirements around online assessment.\n:thought_balloon: E-Assessment benefits\n\nUsing technology can bring many benefits to the assessment process and some of these are outlined below:\n\n    Greater variety and authenticity in the design of assessments\n\n    Improved learner engagement, for example through interactive formative assessments with adaptive feedback\n\n    Choice in the timing and location of assessments\n\n    Capture of wider skills and attributes not easily assessed by other means, for example through simulations, e-portfolios and interactive games\n\n    Efficient submission, marking, moderation and data storage processes\n\n    Consistent, accurate results with opportunities to combine human and computer marking\n\n    Immediate feedback\n\n    Increased opportunities for learners to act on  feedback, for example by reflection in e-portfolios\n\n    Innovative approaches based around the use of creative media and online peer and self-assessment\n\n    Accurate, timely and accessible evidence on the effectiveness of curriculum design and delivery\n\n(JISC, 2010, p. 9)\n\nHow to Set Up an Assessment?, IT_Helpdesk, Step 1 - Navigate to the module you would like to add an assessment to.\n\nStep 2 - Click on \u201cTurn editing on\u201d in the top right of the page.\n\nStep 3 - Scroll to any section where you\u2019ll see \u201cadd activity or resource\u201d click it to display the menu of activities.\n\n \n\nBeneath each activity and resource you can press:\n\n :star:To save specific activities an resources for easier future browsing to the Starred tab\n\n :info:To read more about each activity.\n\nStep 4 - Select the activity to display the contents page.\n\n \n\nStep 5 - Fill in the details of the activity or resource.\n\nOnce you are done, click  Save and return to course or  Save and display.\nOptions for Assessment in Moodle, IT_Helpdesk, Moodle offers many different styles of assessment, from quizzes to peer assessment to video assignments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd33b9e4-8b94-47c8-bf63-7b6f679d9728": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd33b9e4-8b94-47c8-bf63-7b6f679d9728", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "18591b1b-9711-4e86-8341-31eaa014feca", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4af4e6eda51c0655d7fc5e158c7710167c11058db49531c3799e48d56cab553e"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e32dd83-9cd5-4b16-97d5-152b3b455fb3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7075801e06c21843e9b15447c1729da5f44a46a1b3dba36c3147de0a3c102593"}}, "hash": "678007f049cdaa1108d0dca3f3c63f95b392760e69ff5fc7c24125aebf59dd4e", "text": "Quiz: The Quiz activity allows you to design and build quizzes consisting of a large variety of question types, including multiple-choice, true-false, and short answer questions. Questions are kept in the Question Bank and can be re-used in quizzes in different modules. Moodle Quiz can help to build students\u2019 confidence by providing opportunities for them to consolidate their learning, and offering instant personalized feedback. Lecturers can also benefit from using quizzes to identify parts of the curriculum that students are struggling with and to gather feedback about the content covered in lectures. Moodle Quiz activity supports diagnostic and formative assessment as well as summative exams.\n\nAssignment Guide: There are three separate assignment activities in Moodle \u2013 Turnitin, Moodle, and Video assignment. Assignment activities in Moodle enable students to submit their coursework as a file upload or online text and allows the Lecturer to assess, grade and provide feedback. Our Assignment Guide outlines the functionality of each activity to help you to select a tool that meets your requirements.\n\nPeer Assessment Guide: Peer assessment is the assessment of students\u2019 work by their peers against set assessment criteria. By assessing or evaluating each other\u2019s work, students take up the role of appraisers and, over time, acquire the skills they need to make judgments on their own work. In general, there are two types of peer assessments:\n\n    Assessment of team contribution in group work \u2013 members of a group assess the performance of their peers in terms of their contribution to the group\u2019s work.\n    Assessment of coursework undertaken by other students \u2013 students provide feedback/grades on their peers\u2019 work.\n    In either case, self-assessment may be included as part of peer assessment. Self-assessment requires students to reflect on their own work and judge how well they have performed in relation to the assessment criteria. Developing reflective skills provides students with the ability to consider their own performance and to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas that require improvement. Students can then use this knowledge to influence their future work, whether on a program of study or in employment. Moodle has two peer assessment activities and also the Database and Forum activity which can be used to support Peer Assessment. Our Peer Assessment Guide outlines the functionality of each activity to help you select a tool that meets your requirements.\n\nForum: The Forum activity allows students and lecturers to exchange ideas by posting comments as part of a \u2018thread\u2019. The Forum can be used for formative and summative assessments that require students to communicate, collaborate, debate or critique.\n\nWiki: A wiki is a collaboratively designed webpage or series of webpages. Each time a person makes changes to a wiki page, their revision of the content becomes the current version, and an older version is stored. Edits can be reverted if necessary. Wikis can be used for formative and summative assessments that require students to collaborate and co-create content.\nAssignment Feedback Files & Feedback comments, IT_Helpdesk, you may return annotated files to students through a Moodle Assignment, if you want to make comments on files (for example, using Track Changes in a Word document or adding comments to a PDF). \n\nAdditionally, Moodle can automatically match feedback files to the proper student if all contributions are downloaded to a .zip file, the original file names supplied by Moodle are retained, the files are compressed into a new .zip file, and the .zip file is uploaded to a Moodle Assignment. This is especially handy if you want to annotate several files but don't want to publish them all separately to give students comments.\nHow to Enable the feedback files option?, IT_Helpdesk, Step 1 - On your main module page, click Turn editing on.

The file is similar to a .zip archive file and is a way to save the information from an entire course - including student data - in one compressed package. You might want to take a backup file to another school's Moodle server, move it to a new course site on the same server, or simply keep it on your own hard drive or in your own Google Drive space for future use.  Unpacking a backup in a new location on Moodle is called doing a RESTORE. \n\nThere is also a way to IMPORT files from one-course site on Moodle to another, which moves files and activities but does not include most student data. To learn more about the difference between RESTORE and IMPORT, see Restoring a Course Backup to an Empty Course Site. If you'd prefer to use the import function, see Adding Material from Past Courses, earlier in this guide. If you're uncertain which to use, please contact Digital Pedagogy.\n:blue_book: Instructions\nHow to Create a course Backup file?\nStep 1 - Go to your Moodle course -> Gear Icon (to the right of the course title) > Backup.\n\n \n\nStep 2 - Look through the default Initial settings that are checked and check any additional settings that you want to use, then click the Next button.\n\n \n\nStep 3 - Schema settings - Uncheck any boxes for items you don't want to include in the backup, such as empty weeks or topics, then click the Next button.\n\nStep 4 - Confirmation and review - Review your Initial settings and Schema setting items, check that everything is as required, then click Perform Backup.\n\n \n\n \n\nStep 5 - Depending on the size of your course, the progress bar may take a few minutes to complete your backup.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9367bc88-7598-43d7-bbed-2b72c38daa37": {"__data__": {"id_": "9367bc88-7598-43d7-bbed-2b72c38daa37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "ee0ba523-7d13-428c-af89-5d6836d3d62c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c864fd17b97561e5a1361008f66ad837022fc20d06300e4c26ef29fe491c2257"}, "3": {"node_id": "8e4d25c8-031f-423e-a6a0-9d81aca8e802", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2715fcf0885c2765f90092f9c8096557457abe0cf3141ea479d33249bd71ce75"}}, "hash": "fd07ac7ca9805c4cb26b92541624273cad32c61f150feecca8759d413228b87e", "text": "You do not need to wait here,  the process can also continue in the background.\n\n \n\nStep 6 - Click \"Continue.\"\n\n \n\nStep 7 - The final screen that appears is for managing your backup files.

There are different workflows to hide and release grades to students via Turnitin assignments and Quizzes.\n\nTo ensure that students receive their grades at the same time, the following guidance will explain how you can hide grades from student view while inputting grades and feedback, and how you can then release grades / feedback to students simultaneously.\n\nWhen you are marking student assignments and have hidden the assignment via Setup in Grades ,it is important that you do not make any changes to the setting Notify students in the Assignment settings. If you change this to No at any stage in the marking process an automatic notification from Moodle will not be sent to students informing them of the release of their grades and feedback.\nMarking Workflow\n\nIf you are using Marking Workflow you will still need to hide the assignment following the guidance below.\n\nPlease note that when you set the grades and feedback to Released within Marking Workflow an email notification will not be automatically sent to students. You will need to let students know that their grades and feedback are available by using either Quickmail or posting to the News Forum.

The most common settings are point and simple direct grading.\n\n    If you need to use the more advance settings:\n\n    Please refer to the guidance on how to use scales as grades, and Marking Record and Grades as grading methods.\n\n    Please refer to the guidance on Facilitating multiple markers and anonymous marking if you need to set a process with several markers or blind marking.\n\n    Due to the way that groups are managed in Moodle, it is not possible to have an anonymous group assignment as the group name displays in the assignment submission area. This means that lecturers who may have set up the groups can differentiate between the submissions or can go to the groups in Moodle to see the group members via Settings >Users > Groups.\n\nStep 10- Common settings: In the Common module settings, you can decide if you want to show or hide your assignment using the Availability settings. You do not need to change the group mode, this is managed from Group assignment settings in step 7.\nGroups in Moodle, IT_Helpdesk, You can assign different group modes to activities within Moodle which will shape how that activity behaves. For groups to work correctly all students must be assigned to a group.\n\n    Example: Applying a group mode under Common module settings within Assignments enables different markers to filter the submissions between groups. This means that the lecturer can view and mark the submissions in the group they are responsible for marking.\n\n    Collaborative Activities: Within collaborative activities such as Forums or Wikis, the group mode under Common module settings can be used to engage students in group work (i.e each group has their own collaborative workspace).\n\n    Assignment Tool: The assignment tool offers an option from Group assignment settings for students to submit one piece of work on behalf of their group and for you to assign the same mark and feedback to the entire group.\n\n    Restricting Access: Groups can be used to define which group can access an activity or resource. If you want to restrict an activity or resource to ensure that only students in a group can access it, select Group under Restrict access when setting up the activity.\nGroupings, IT_Helpdesk,     Groupings are collections of groups. If a student is in more than one group, or you want a subset of groups to work on an activity, you will need to use Groupings for the Groups to work correctly on the activity.\n        Example: If you had not set up Groupings in this scenario, Moodle would have no way of knowing which groups needed to be attached to the Forum. Joe Bloggs would have had access to two Forums one for Tutor Group 1 and one for Project Group B!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "634f2969-397a-4b0c-8ccc-9888bab2041c": {"__data__": {"id_": "634f2969-397a-4b0c-8ccc-9888bab2041c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "92e6db5e-517b-4fc6-bc3a-6d5391a96e99", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "80a5cbe484237d8b35d9f2221076128820ce321d5e857604cbef8d52720c9505"}, "3": {"node_id": "ad7db4a9-6097-456f-a1df-bec95675a30f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "db27b1480b2129e22bb496f3d293437c338bc343e33a13de9db7ef7d786db2c0"}}, "hash": "581351232d95fa90dacba6da49f7dfef69b19bbd9ca163e0b6ca31b102b8c17a", "text": "Groups Setting in Activities:, IT_Helpdesk,     Reasons to Use Groups:\n        Groups can be used to define how students work or collaborate in activity by choosing different group modes.\n        Depending on which group mode you choose, activities will behave differently.\n        Restrict access to a resource or activity.\n\n    How to Apply Group Mode to Activities:\n        Turn Editing On and Edit Settings: Navigate to the module homepage and Turn editing on.

For example, if the quiz is closed to all students because the quiz\u2019s original close date/time has passed and you do not adjust the override\u2019s close date/time, even if you give a specific student a second attempt, they will not be able to access the quiz.\nHow do I restrict access to items or activities to certain groups or students of the course?, IT_Helpdesk, There are some modules that has two intakes starting in the same month ex.(062020) which will be in one course in Moodle. Therefor, you can differentiate between them by choosing the targeted groups from the filter in participants page as below:\n\n \n\nThere are many cases in which it is useful to restrict access to material or activities in Moodle.  \n\nFor example -  sharing information with graders or keeping extra material hidden which can be done by following the below steps:\n\nStep 1 - Click on Turn editing on from top right gear \n\n\n\nStep 2 - Create or edit the resource or activity you want to limit access to.\n\n \n\nStep 3 - Under Restrict Access, click Add restriction and Select \u201cGroup\u201d and pick the group you want to have access to the item i.e Group A.\n\nYou can also combine a number of restrictions if you continue to click Add restriction.\n\nClick on the eyeball next to your group so that the item will be hidden totally from users not in that group.\n\nStep 4 - Save changes.  When you return to the course main page you will see an indication that the item is restricted.\n\n \n\n \nRestricting Topics\n\nIt is possible to add a group restriction on a topic or week.  Follow the same procedure as above, but set the restriction on the entire topic.  You will need to leave the topic and all its contents visible, but Moodle will display a label indicating that access to the topic is restricted.

Please note the enrollment process is automated by the system. In order to not confuse the materials and activities intended for different groups a solution is to utilise restrictions (see step 4 of article) so that the students from different intakes will be able to see materials meant for them while being in the same folder.\n\nImportant Tip -  If you restrict access to an entire section, all activities in that section will follow the restrictions set. That way, you do not have to set restrictions one by one for each activity.\nHow to add a sections and duplicate resources in Moodle, IT_Helpdesk, The following article describes the steps for adding a new section(topic) within another section and allocating resources from preexisting sections.\n\nStep 1 - In the upper right corner of the modules page, click \u201cTurn editing on\u201d\n\nStep 2 - After clicking on Turn editing on, scroll down to the bottom of the page, then click on the Add topics.Write number of sections you need and click Add topics.\n\nStep 3 - For editing name click on the pencil icon :pencil2:  next to the topic name, write new name and click on the enter on your laptop/PC keyboard.\n\nStep 4 - Duplicate the topic : Click on the Edit drop down menu, from the menu click on the Duplicate. \n\nThe duplication process would take time based on the resource size.\nMoving a Resource/Activity\n\nTo move a resource, click and hold on the moving icon on the left side of the resource, you can drag and drop it in other topics.\nHow to change/increase assignment submission file size?, IT_Helpdesk, If you want to change/increase assignment submission file size then, follow the steps below;\nPart 1 \n\nStep 1 - Click the :gear: gear icon on the top-right of the page and select edit settings\n\nStep 2 - Click Edit on the assignment or activity that you want to amend then  click on Edit settings from the drop-down list.\nPart 2\n\nStep 1 - Scroll down until Submission types and click on it.\n\nStep 2 - Click on the Maximum submission size drop-down to change the file size to be uploaded in this activity or assignment.\n\nIf you want to increase the maximum upload size limit which is currently by default 250 MB then you can change the setting in the course material upload setting, click here to know more.\n\nStep 3 - Click Save and return to course or Save and display.\n\nThe maximum submission file size for Turnitin Assignment can\u2019t increase more than 100MB as it is Turnitin limitation.\nHow to change/increase upload file size of course material?, IT_Helpdesk, You can change/increase upload file size setting of course material to be uploaded, by following the steps below:\n\nStep 1 - Click on the :gear:  icon found at the top right corner of the page.\n\nStep 2 - Click on  :gear: Edit settings.\n\nStep 3 - Scroll down until Files and uploads section.\n\nStep 4 - Click on the Maximum upload size drop-down to specify the maximum file size to be uploaded in this course.\n\nStep 5 - Click Save and display.\n\nThe maximum submission file size for Turnitin Assignment can\u2019t increase more than 100MB as it is Turnitin limitation\nHow to Create a Course in Moodle?, IT_Helpdesk, A guide in Moodle is a complete training session with theory and practice. The theory helps to convey knowledge with the help of lessons containing text, images, and videos; hands-on activities such as quizzes (check out our How to Create a Moodle Quiz: Step-by-Step Guide) allow you to check how much the student has learned.\nCreating a Lesson in Moodle\n\nAs an example, we\u2019ll build a course on Workplace Safety rules and a lesson on Fire Safety.

For this example, we will add only 1 (one) topic and click Add topics.\n\n \n\nStep 4 - A new topic will be created Topic 1, rename this to Fire Safety and then, in this section of topic click Add an activity or resources. From Add an activity or resources popup window, under the list of Activities look for Lesson, select this activity and click Add.\n\nYou will be redirected to a page for the configuration of this Lesson. We\u2019ll need to set up four sections:\n\n    General: Enter the name of the lesson and its description.\n\n    Appearance: Configure the lesson design. Would you like learners to see a progress bar or demonstrate the lesson as a slideshow?\n\n    Flow Control: Set up the rules for taking the lesson. For example, it\u2019d be wise to allow learners to view the lesson on fire safety several times, but for an exam session, it\u2019s better to give just one attempt.\n\n    Grade: Determine the rules of assessment. Will you use points or a scale to evaluate the results? What is the passing grade? For the sample lesson, set four points as the passing grade as there are four test tasks.\n\nStep 5 - Click Save and display.\n\n \nHow to Create a Question Page?\n\nStep 6 - Our sample lesson starts with the question, What do you do if you smell smoke?

When there\u2019s smoke in the building, you must leave immediately. By wasting time on packing things, you may lose your chance to get out, as smoke and fire spread very quickly.\n\nStep 9 - Click Save page.\n\n    Your question page will be successfully added to the course.\n\n \nHow to Create a Content Page?\n\nStep 10 - The content page is a building block for creating a lesson in Moodle. It may contain text, pictures, audio or video. You can click Add a content page in the beginning.\n\nStep 11 - But in our case of this sample course, we first created question page after, we can create more pages by clicking on Add new page and from drop-down list select Add a content page.\n\n    Below, you will also see a Content 1 (Content 2, Content 3, and so on) section. Using these fields, you can set up navigation within a lesson. Each Content is a button that forwards a learner to another page of the lesson. For instance, you can create buttons for every page of the lesson using the Jump option, so learners will be able to jump to a different page \u2013 next page, previous page, first page, last page, or any other page on the course. If you prefer closed navigation and don\u2019t fill in the Content fields, then learners will have to study the pages one by one.\n\n    For the sample course, we don\u2019t need any extra navigation buttons except Next and Previous.\n\nStep 12 - Create the Next button by entering the word, Next in the Content 1 description and choose to jump to the Next page on each new page you add, and Previous in the Content 2 description and choose to jump to Previous page on each new page you add.\n\n \nHow to Add More Content and Question Pages?\n\nStep 13 - Create the rest of the pages using the lesson source file.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "948dc99a-36aa-42df-a219-8f28f06f03bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "948dc99a-36aa-42df-a219-8f28f06f03bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "2ab4fab6-ca60-4bad-a89e-f7f29492eb9f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0022ce20543d315cd71c63f900335185153beef9ebb18fbeee57eb8e98bfd15"}, "3": {"node_id": "85e48713-a9b6-46dd-b929-a634255d9f2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9fc4ab2a4dcff1ccb886a88a4a3cf33e8d734109b766ca8643667db6abd1d1e3"}}, "hash": "53f7fb52e6837e5245f270d2c1b06bb71ef24ba996ae582a5bf14b662647aaaf", "text": "Step 13 - Create the rest of the pages using the lesson source file.

We will also create a small linear sample quiz together to put theory into practice right away. You can download the sample quiz here [https://dif7uuh3zqcps.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2020/03/01190408/Sample-Questions-for-Moodle-Quiz.docx]\n\nNow, let\u2019s get started.\n\nStep 1 - Open your Course in Moodle\n\nStep 2 - From the course overview, open your class specific folder.\n\nStep 3 - Click \u201cTurn editing on\u201d\n\nWhen you open class specific folder on Moodle, on the top right corner of the page click on setting gear icon. A drop down menu list will open and from this list select Turn editing on.\n\n \n\nStep 4 - Click on \u201cAdd activity or resources\n\nStep 5 - Scroll down and you will see the option to Add an activity or resource. Click on it and a window will pop up with list of activity and resources.\n\nStep 6 -  Add quiz: From Add an activity or resources popup window, under the list of Activities look for Quiz, select this activity and click Add. You will be redirected to a page for the configuration of this new Quiz.\n\nStep 7 - Set up Quiz: Enter the quiz name and its description. It\u2019s also important to set a number of options so that students do not cheat. You can find details on each option in this Moodle help doc; in this article, we\u2019ll cover the basic settings.\n\nFor this tutorial, we will name the quiz \u201cTutorial 1-Quiz\u201d and description shown in the screenshot below.\n\n \n\n    Setting #1: Timing. Protect From Cheating\n\nBy default, students have unlimited time to pass the quiz; they can get started today and finish in three days with the highest score by copying the answers from the textbook. To obtain credible results, we will set an assessment period and time limit.\n\nYou can set the start date and time of the quiz by checking Enable in Open the quiz option. The quiz will automatically open on the set date and time, for example in the screenshot below the test will open on 2 April 2020 at 10 am, until that students will only see the description of the quiz.\n\nLikewise, you can set the end date and time of the quiz by checking Enable in Close the quiz option. The quiz will automatically close at the set time and date, for example in the screenshot below the test will close on 3 April 2020 at 10 am. If a student forgets to take the quiz in time then, he or she will automatically fail the quiz.\n\nNext, we will set the quiz Time limit. Usually, 30 minutes to an hour is enough, but it depends on the complexity of the assessment. In some cases, students may need 3 or 4 hours. When students start answering questions, they see a countdown timer that shows how much time is left, and when the time expires, the quiz is automatically closed. For example, we will set a time limit for 30 minutes for this sample quiz.\n\nThe rest of the options in this section can be left as they are by default.\n\n \n\n    Setting #2: Grade. Set a Passing Grade\n\nWith the default settings, your students have an unlimited number of attempts to answer the same question. As a result, a quiz can be passed by a random choice method: they make a mistake and immediately change the answer, and so on until they pass. If you prefer students not to play guessing games, limit the number of attempts, and set a passing score.\n\nGrade to pass \u2013 Set a minimal passing grade. This is the minimum score required to pass a quiz. The pass grades are highlighted in green, and fail grades in red. As there are only two questions in this sample quiz, let\u2019s set one (1) point as the passing grade.\n\nAttempts allowed \u2013 Limit the number of attempts to avoid guessing games. If this is a final exam, you can give just one attempt, and perhaps three for a pop quiz.\n\n \n\n    Setting #3: Layout.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85e48713-a9b6-46dd-b929-a634255d9f2e": {"__data__": {"id_": "85e48713-a9b6-46dd-b929-a634255d9f2e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "948dc99a-36aa-42df-a219-8f28f06f03bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "53f7fb52e6837e5245f270d2c1b06bb71ef24ba996ae582a5bf14b662647aaaf"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ee9a807-d415-4973-a27e-16cf0e8b673e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2e2e09ca67682c9bc36f108ec24ba0f46655af252b154c4be695a78cba7ffcb3"}}, "hash": "9fc4ab2a4dcff1ccb886a88a4a3cf33e8d734109b766ca8643667db6abd1d1e3", "text": "Setting #3: Layout.

Since there are only two questions in this sample quiz, the highest score will be two (2) points. Specify the maximum score. In this case, it\u2019s 2 points\n\nStep 9 - Add Quiz Questions: In Moodle, there are 15 types of questions you can add. We will create two of the most popular question types, True/False and Multiple Choice, so you can master the principles of making quizzes in Moodle and easily create other types of tasks on your own. Click on Add > a new question and Choose a question type to add window will popup.\n\n \n\n    True/False Question\n\nFrom Choose a question type to add popup window, under the list of Questions look for True/False, select this question type and click Add. You will be redirected to a page to set up True/False questions.\n\nIn the Adding a True/False question page, fill in a question name and question text (download sample quiz). You can also add images, video, audio, or a link to additional material on the topic of the question.\n\n \n\nStep 10 - set the Correct answer. In our sample, the statement is true, so choose True in the drop down list. You can also add feedback for the response so that a learner can better understand the topic and improve it next time.\n\n \n\nStep 11 - Click Save changes to publish the question; it will look like this:\n\n \n\n    Multiple Choice Question\n\nFrom Choose a question type to add popup window, under the list of Questions look for Multiple Choice, select this question type and click Add. You will be redirected to a page to set up True/False questions.\n\n \n\nIn the Adding a Multiple choice question page, fill in a question name and question text (download sample quiz). You can also add images, video, audio, or a link to additional material on the topic of the question.\n\n \n\nIn multiple choice questions, there can be more than one correct answers, but there is only one correct response in our sample question. Let\u2019s choose this option \u2013 One answer only,  in the question settings. You can also set to shuffle choice for better control on cheating answers.\n\n \n\nNow, add all the choices for the queston and you need to select the correct answer and give it a 100% grade. The rest of the responses are false, so we do not give points for choosing them and select None.\n\n \n\nThe rest of the options can be left at default. Click on Save changes. The published task looks like this:\n\n \n\nYou can also apply some additional display options such as:\n\n    Whether correct: show or don\u2019t show students if the response was correct\n\n    Marks: show or don\u2019t show students how much they score\n\n    General feedback: show students a certain message upon completing the quiz\n\nTo find these options, click Preview question (a magnifying glass with a plus sign next to each question), scroll down and set them up in a pop-up window.\n\n \n\nThe quiz is now ready. All you need to do now is to assign it to students and keep track of their results from the Grades tab.\nOpen a Question Bank: \n\nSo far, we have been discussing creating a quiz from scratch.

The Gradebook collects items that have been graded from the various assessed activities in Moodle and allows you to view and change them, as well as sort grade items into categories and calculate totals in various ways. When you add an assessed activity in a Moodle course, the Gradebook automatically creates space for the grades it will produce and then adds the grades as they are generated, either by the system (e.g. quizzes) or by you (e.g. assignments). Many activities in Moodle can be graded, including glossary and database entries (using ratings), lessons, quizzes, assignments, questionnaires, SCORM/AICC packages and scheduler meetings. \nWhy use it?\n\nTo manage and view all student grades for a particular module.\n\nTo define the way grades are displayed to students - e.g. letter grades, percentages, scale grades etc.\nWho can use it?\n\nTutors or course administrators can use the Gradebook to view and manage grades. \n\nStudents can use the Gradebook to view their own grades only.\n\n \n:thought_balloon: Before I start...\n\nWhen viewing the Gradebook there are three different types of reports you can view:\n1. Grader Report\n\nThe Grader report is shown by default and shows each student down the left side and each category, gradable activity and grade for the current Moodle course along the top of the page. The list of students can be sorted using the arrows alongside each activity name. Clicking the name of the activity will take you to the student's attempts for that activity, assuming there are some. The course total displays to the far right, so you may need to scroll down and to the right to see this.\n2. User Report\n\nThe User report is what students see by default and shows the grade, percentage and feedback for each activity in the course. To view a student's grades, choose their name from the Select all or one user drop down menu on the right. You can filter by user to see the grades for any of your students. To view all the students' grades on one page (one after the other) select All users from the menu.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e4c8ac4-4e3f-40d9-8ff9-4f15c2faa5f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e4c8ac4-4e3f-40d9-8ff9-4f15c2faa5f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "151db247-9553-4071-b781-25639a8ed4ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6bf41b62ac12a4f505095950d331718c9acbb631cbfc458162e079a9ac843ddb"}, "3": {"node_id": "d7750a39-b80c-4744-b29d-d104a2481b7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a7f8e7b49173221972cf8857cc673fc799e5cc451dfb5fc7ebcb7bdda2f98ad3"}}, "hash": "7682a97150da872604caa8873f552fe87469b2c7327f2278835f2caeff2ba1d8", "text": "3.

You can use simple direct grading but it is NOT advisable to use that if your activity consists of multiple subcomponents. The integration will not work properly.\n\nCase 2 -  Ensure that the marking guide / rubrics are configured properly and used. Below is what happens when you have advanced grading setup but do not use it:\n\nNo subcomponents will be available\n\nThis is the notice you will see in the grading setup\n\nIf you intend to use simple grading, then the grading method must be set as such. Otherwise, if you intend to use marking guide/rubrics, then you must prepare it for use.\n\nCase 3 -  Do not override the marks as it will cause issues when exporting to OBE. If you override the marks, it will be highlighted as yellow in the gradebook. Doing so will cause issues when exporting marks to OBE:\n\nDo not do this. If you want to rectify the marks of a student, please regrade them in the grader accordingly and save the marks again.\n\nCase 4 - If you do not find a particular student\u2019s name when exporting marks (or you saw students under this tab while exporting):\n\nplease check to ensure that the lecture class code is assigned to them in the Participants tab. It is exactly like assigning a group to a student for group assignment purposes. REMEMBER to click on the disk icon to save. Otherwise, it will not register.\n\nCase 5 - If you have made any changes to the marks after you have finalised your results, you will need to request assessment team to unfinalise them so that the new results can be finalised.\n\nCase 6 -  Do not touch the grade weightage in Moodle, the grades in Moodle will auto-scale when exported to OBE:\n\nDo not touch the weightage, leave it as default. If you have made changes to it, just untick them.\n\nCase 7 -  If you made any changes to your rubric / marking guide AFTER you have marked your students, remember to save those marks again (just click save if the marks are already there). Otherwise, if you export to OBE, the grades will not register and export properly.\n\nPlease take note of this error message in the grader\n\nCase 8 -  If you noticed that the results in OBE were not exported correctly, check your rubric / marking guide for any error messages. You may come across something like this if you did not set your marks properly:\n\nThe message is self-explanatory. If this is what is interfering with marks exporting, either adjust your rubric / marking guide or the total marks in your activity. Be warned that if you made changes, you will need to save all the marks again.\n\nCase 9 -  Please ensure that the components in your rubric / marking guide DO NOT share the same name, otherwise this will cause issues. Like the case above, if you make a changes to the rubric / marking guide (component names included), you will need to save all the marks again.\n\nCase 10 -  ALWAYS check your Module Descriptor and ensure that there are no mistakes in there because it WILL affect marks. For example:\n\nCheck how many questions need to be fulfilled and if it is supposed to be all questions or just a particular number only. If you, for example, select 1 out of 4, OBE will always pick the highest score.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ff277e5-54ad-447d-b2bd-d0b587b406b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ff277e5-54ad-447d-b2bd-d0b587b406b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "7c7799da-dc62-4fc4-8d65-082670564b66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c99fd0f1220e0029349b008deb42521a286c9cba97f8658d41cb859973bf0dac"}, "3": {"node_id": "1e54b157-6d34-4e73-99ab-ee2fb6ea8a12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "bd213318eefabf6d7302534de28a80fbf214f70cfbfcb287c84edac8305c15a7"}}, "hash": "efe17e6dcca4e12019c39adccbf7531dcca93d07f87ebfd84c3d43a97cdf46f5", "text": "If that is not supposed to be the case, please correct your Module Descriptor.\n\nCase 11 -  If your exam marks do not reflect correctly in OBE, ensure that ALL questions are graded, even if they were not answered by students (applies only for exams where all questions need to be answered). Otherwise, there will be mark disparity in OBE.\n\nCase 12 -  Ensure that your marking guide matches EXACTLY your module descriptor requirements. For example, if your module descriptor requires 4 out of 6 sub-components to be fulfilled, you MUST have 6 criteria in your marking guide even if you are not using all of them (applies to lecturers who use Assignment to conduct exams). Otherwise, you may face an issue where you could not export your marks to OBE.\n\nImportant: You may come across a situation where the max grade of your marking guide is more than the default 100 marks (for example 150) after you include all criteria. This can be resolved by changing the total marks here in your assignment settings:\n\n    If students have already submitted, go to the \u2018Rescale existing grades\u2019 option and select Yes, then change the maximum grade to match the maximum grade of your marking guide.\n\n    If students have not submit, just change the maximum grade. \n\nCase 13 -  Do not match the same subcomponents in your module descriptor to different marking criteria in Moodle if you have more than one of it. For example:\n\nIn OBE, this component has 2 subcomponents. If you match only one of the subcomponents to two different criteria in Moodle as such:\n\nIt will not work properly.\nOffline Marking for Moodle Assignment Submissions, IT_Helpdesk, You may grade Assignment submissions without being logged in to Moodle or connected to the Internet using Moodle's offline grading feature.

This is useful for singling out any students or groups facing issues (such as not being able to properly submit answers) and allowing them only access to the exam for a second attempt.\nIndividual User Override\n\nStep 1 - Go to Edit and look for \u2018User Overrides\u2019\n\nThis step allows exam unit to give affected student an extra attempt to complete the exam\n\nStep 2 - Add user override\n\nYou may add multiple user overrides.\n\nStep 3 - Input the fields\n\n    Override user: The name of the affected student\n\n    Require password: Require the student to enter password (normally not necessary)\n\n    Open the quiz: When the quiz starts\n\n    Close the quiz: When the quiz ends\n\n    Time limit: Time given for student to complete attempt\n\n    Attempts allowed: The number of attempts allowed to students\n\n Add one extra attempt. For example, if 1 attempt was given by default, then put 2 when doing the override to allow a second attempt in submission.\n\nStep 4 - Go to Edit Settings and look for Question Behaviour\n\nTake note of the last option. Set it to Yes temporarily, this will make it so that it does not change the order of questions when re-attempting so student will continue where they left off.\n\n If the student did not click Finish and Submit at the end of the quiz, all there is need to be done is just go to the end of the quiz and ensure the button is clicked.  \n\nStep 5 - Once the student has submitted the attempt, revert the \u2018Each attempt builds on the last\u2019 back to No.\nGroup Override\n\nGroup override functions like user override, except for this case, it covers a whole group instead.\n\nStep 1 - Go to Edit and look for \u2018Group Overrides\u2019\n\nStep 2 - Add group overrides\n\nStep 3 - Input the fields\n\nOnce done, any student belonging to the selected group will be able to obtain an extra attempt in the exam.

Expand the settings by clicking on it.\n\nClick on the Add restriction\u2026 button, a choice of conditions appears.\n\nWhat conditions are available for restriction?\n\n    Activity Completion\n    Activity Completion is enabled by default on new modules. If you are working on a pre-2019/20 module you will need to enable Completion Tracking from Settings>>Edit settings. Once you have set up Activity completion on an activity or resource, Activity completion becomes an option available from the Add restriction menu.\n\n    You can use the Activity completion settings to define what constitutes completion. Restrict access in combination with Activity completion means that you can require that students view certain resources or complete certain activities before moving on to others.\n\n    Activity completion Example\u2026\n\n    Date\n    Access can be restricted from or until a certain date and time.\n\n    Grade\n    You can specify a condition on any grade in the course: the full course grade, or the grade for any activity in the module. You can enter either a minimum value (at least percentage), a maximum value (less than percentage), both, or neither by clicking on the relevant checkbox.\n\n    Grade Example\u2026\n\n    Groups\n    If Groups and Groupings are set up in the module, it is possible to restrict the activity or resource to a certain group or grouping (which is a cluster of groups). If you choose the option \u2018Any group\u2019, the resource/activity will be available to a student who has been assigned to a group (any group). It should not be misinterpreted as students who are not associated with any group.\n\n    Groups Example\u2026\n\n    User Profile\n    Every user account in Moodle has profile fields like name, city, country, etc. You can select to restrict the availability of materials base on a student\u2019s Moodle identity. Some useful profile fields are:\n        First name\n        Email address\n\n    This data is drawn from our student record system \u2013 GIMS and is recorded in specific coding. Please liaise with your course office if you want to utilize these fields.\n\n    User Profile Example\u2026\n\n    Restriction set\n    This allows you to add a set of nested restrictions combining the use of the above conditions in order to achieve a more complex logic.\n\nHow to choose ALL or ANY conditions?\n\nIf you add more than one restriction, you can decide if all the conditions need to be met or only some of them.\n\n    ALL\n    ALL the conditions need to be met. These are AND conditions.\n\n    ANY\n    ANY of the conditions are required before the activity is made available. These are OR conditions.\n\n    For example - referral student can be restricted by:\n    User Profile -> email address -> start with -> Student id (small letter: tp088393)\n\nWhat will students see if a resource, activity or section has Restrict Access applied?\n\nNo matter which condition setting you have chosen, you can choose to either grey out/hide the activity/resource completely. To set these options, you use the eye icon next to the condition:\n\n    Shut-eye\n    If the eye is SHUT then students who do not meet that part of the condition will not see the activity at all.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2bde5dd-bdfc-4ae9-9741-6e39105ee592": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2bde5dd-bdfc-4ae9-9741-6e39105ee592", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "13de4482-0ad0-419d-ad9a-9c644356152b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "638362a4f428acb605a6c03d36dfb9ac7ae0ae1e986c7430e695196919d5e69c"}, "3": {"node_id": "73233da7-dc44-4982-84f8-1b1bf1369247", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7385ba076251a364a7e1edad962d234dfcaa4019097549af05009165cee72ce8"}}, "hash": "c9c0c6f35433ef34a03da51482867ba100d6b55648d00509f5a7fdd889cf10fb", "text": "Open-eye\n    If the eye is OPEN the students who do not meet that part of the condition will see the activity but it will be greyed out and have information about why they can\u2019t access it yet.\n\nThe shut-eye takes precedence. For example, you could have two conditions, one based on date (with eye shut) and one based on completing a previous activity (with eye open). The activity will not appear for students until the date; then it will be visible with information for students explaining that they need to complete an activity before they can access the materials. When students complete the activity they can access the resources.\n\nExample student view with open-eye for restrictions: Student id has to be small letter (tp088393)\n\nSetting up group assignments, IT_Helpdesk, When setting up group assignments, you may sometimes want to use custom groups for this purpose. Lecturers can create custom groups for that purpose. You may refer to Moodle\u2019s comprehensive documentation here on how to do it.\n\nOnce you have created your groups, there is one more step you need to do before you set up your group assignment: grouping. Grouping will force the assignment to use the groups you specify rather than it using something unintended. You may refer to Moodle\u2019s comprehensive documentation here [https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Groups] on how to do it.\nSet up groups\n\nStep 1 - First, go to the \u2018:busts_in_silhouette: Participants\u2019 tab. of the module you wish to create groups in.\n\nStep 2- Click on the :gear:  icon and click on \u2018:busts_in_silhouette: Groups\u2019\n\nStep 3 -Click on \u2018Create Group\u2019\n\nStep 4 - Fill in the required fields and click \u201cSave changes\u201d\n\n \nCreate groupings\n\nStep 1 - Once you have created your desired groups, in the Group page, look for the tab called \u2018Groupings\u2019 and click on it\n\nStep 2 - Click on \u2018Create Grouping\u2019\n\nStep 3 - Create your grouping by entering at least the group name and once finished , click Save Changes \n\nStep 4 - Once saved, click on the :bust_in_silhouette:  person icon on the far right\n\nStep 5 -  You may now assign groups to the grouping by selecting the group and clicking on either Add or Remove. This will be important when setting up group assignments.\n\nStep 6 - Once you have assigned your required groups to the grouping, you can now select this grouping when creating your group assignment. \n\nWhen you click on the dropdown box for \u2018Grouping for student groups\u2019, you will be able to select the custom grouping you created. Once the assignment is created, all groups that show up in the assignment will only be the groups you assigned to the grouping.\n\n\nSet up a Moodle Marking Record, IT_Helpdesk, A marking record is very similar to a rubric, but it\u2019s simpler. \n\nFor each marking criterion, a comment explains what is being sought, and provides a maximum mark that can be awarded. Students can view the marking criteria before they submit so that they know what their learning priorities are in relation to the assignment. \n\nWhen you come to marking you can view the criteria and add in your comments and grades for each criterion as well as use the \u2018frequently added comments\u2019 function. Marking using a marking record is more detailed and less subjective than awarding a single grade.\n\n    Marking Record should match the assessment criteria available to students for a specific module assignment. \n\n    Assignment criteria explains what a student needs to demonstrate in order to complete an assessment successfully.\n\n     Assessment criteria will differ according to the discipline, the type of assessment and the level of students.\n\nMarking record do not have to be completed online, ensure all your markers are able to mark offline.\n\n \nCreate a marking record for an assignment\n\nStep 1 - On your module page, click Turn editing on\n\nStep 2 - Scroll down to the assignment you wish to edit, click the edit button and select Edit Settings\n\nStep 3 - Scroll down the page to the Grade settings\n\nStep 4 - Select Marking guide from the Grading method drop-down menu.\n\nStep 5 - Click Save and display.\n\nStep 6 -  Define a new grading form.

Quizzes, glossaries, forums, and assignments are all generally called \u2018activities.\u2019\n\nResources are items that you can use to augment training. They can be documents or presentations, or even an external web page such as a certain video from YouTube.\n\nTo add an activity or a resource:\n\nStep 1 - Turn on editing mode by clicking the :gear: icon in the upper right.\n\n \n\nWhen editing is enabled, there\u2019s a + Add an activity or resource after each section of a course.\n\nStep 2 - Click on the + Icon, and you\u2019ll see a pop-up window with the list of all available options and their descriptions. There are 14 types of activities and 7 types of resources.\n\n \nAdding an activity or resource in Moodle\n\nStep 3 - When you have chosen which type of activity or resource you\u2019d like to use, you will be taken directly to the activity/resource\u2019s editing page.\n\n \nHow to add a quiz\n\nStep 1 - Choose a section where you\u2019d like to add a quiz, click + Add an activity or resource, and choose Quiz in the pop-up window. After doing this, you get a quiz settings menu.\n\n \n\n\n \n\nStep 2 - Fill in the name of the quiz. Then you can click Save and return to the the course since Name is the only field required for creating a shell for a quiz. However, feel free to explore other settings in this menu. For example, you can set time frames for assessment or limit the number of attempts allowed.\n\n \n\nStep 3 - Fill this empty quiz shell with some questions. Click Edit quiz and, in a new window, click Add \u2192 + a new question.\n\n \n\nIn Moodle, there are 15 types of questions you can use, such as multiple-choice, matching, and drag and drop.\n\nStep 4 - Choose the type you\u2019d like to use and click Add.\n\n \n\n \n\nStep 5 - In a new window, you\u2019ll need to fill out the details of the question: its name, question text, answers, and feedback. The interface is quite self-explanatory, but in case you have trouble, there are detailed step-by-step instructions on how to create quizzes in Moodle.\n\n \n\nStep 6 - Confirm your details and click Save changes.

Forget the need to check whether the editing mode is on every time you want to change something. Its design capabilities are also limited. So if you need to develop professional eLearning content quicker and easier, there\u2019s iSpring Suite, a fully Moodle-compatible authoring tool.\n\niSpring Suite works as an add-in to PowerPoint. It enriches a familiar PowerPoint interface with special features for developing eLearning content. With its help, you can create interactive e-courses, quizzes, software simulations, YouTube-style video lectures, and dialog simulations \u2014 each of the items can be published as a SCORM package and easily uploaded to Moodle.\n\nIn this blog post, you\u2019ll find a detailed step-by-step tutorial on making a course with Moodle and the same course with iSpring Suite.\n\nPreview of a quiz made in Moodle and the same quiz created with iSpring Suite\nManaging Learners\n\nNow, when your course is ready, it\u2019s time to invite some learners to explore the content.\n\nStep 1 - First, let\u2019s set up the enrollment methods. Within a course, choose the Participants tab in the left menu, then click a gear icon in the upper right and select Enrolment methods from a drop-down menu.\n\n \n\n \n\nThere are three enrollment methods available:\n\n    Manual enrolment\n\n    Guest access\n\n    Self enrolment\n\nBy default, the only option enabled is manual enrollment. If you\u2019d like to activate self enrolment or guest access,\n\nStep 2 - Click the eye icon. If you also click the :gear: icon next to the eye:eye: , you\u2019ll be able to set up some additional settings such as enrolment duration, enrolment password, or the maximum number of users.\n\n \n\n \nCustomizing Your Teacher Profile, IT_Helpdesk, Your teacher profile is available to your learners and colleagues, so it\u2019s a good opportunity to introduce yourself, prove that you\u2019re a human being and not a chatbot, and earn some trust from the students.\n\nStep 1 - Click :bust_in_silhouette: Profile in the upper right corner.\nYou\u2019ll get to your personal page where you can edit personal information, add a photo, and create an introduction.\n\n \n\nStep 2 - Click Edit profile to do this.\n\n \n\nThere, you can enter some text about yourself (or record a video introduction, if you like), place a photo, and leave additional contact information.\n\n \n\nStep 3 - Click on Update profile once done to save your changes\n\n \nHow to add an assignment, IT_Helpdesk, Creating assignments is a feature that you\u2019ll likely use very often as a teacher. With its help, you can ask your students to submit their homework, check how well the unit is being digested, and provide feedback.\n\nStep 1- Just like with quizzes, choose the section where you\u2019d like to add the activity, click + Add an activity or resource, and choose Assignment in the pop-up window.\n\n \n\nStep 2 - In a new window, give the assignment a name and specify what you expect your students to do in a description field. For instance, you can ask them to watch a video and share their opinion on the topic, or ask them to edit a text and submit an improved version, as we did in our example.\n\n \n\nThere are also a number of useful settings that are worth playing with. We\u2019ll mention just a few basic ones.\n\n \nAvailability\n\nIn this section, you can set time frames for submitting assignments or set a reminder to check students\u2019 work before a certain date.\n\n \nSubmission types\n\nIn this section, you\u2019ll need to specify in what format you expect the students to submit their work. Choose Online text if you want them to type their responses right in Moodle, File submissions if you want them to attach a file, or both options at the same time.\n\n \n\nYou can also specify certain file formats and the number of words in essays for the Online Text option.\n\nStep 3 - Click Save and return to course when you\u2019re done.\n\n \nHow to create groups, IT_Helpdesk, For more convenience, you can also divide the enrolled users into groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbbbca1b-8839-4417-85a5-8546bd14b653": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbbbca1b-8839-4417-85a5-8546bd14b653", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd7fb629-3491-41a9-8d03-88b61df0f62d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6850214dce931e7d33f586f6260ce740d28df46e649526daa1408926e45a23fd"}, "3": {"node_id": "b02327ed-0a6c-4c3f-9c75-c9ab3b52d65c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf74e669d18e0c51acb719d61ec4e83450a52a4dabeef176f742a164126afe00"}}, "hash": "3e5c1c16a58b80a52885318999c33e95b190aa79660f0b4097b721be14fbadfe", "text": "It\u2019s especially useful when you have different classes that study the same course, or there\u2019s another teacher assigned to this course, so you would like to split the learners.\nTo create a group:\n\nStep 1 - Click on the :gear: icon in the upper \u201cCreate group.\" After that, name the group, set a picture, enable group messaging if you like, and click Save changes.\n\n \n\n \n\nStep 2 - Again, in a new window, select the group from the list and click Add/remove users from the right.

So, to enroll students in your course:\n\nStep 1 - Choose the Participants tab in the left menu.\n\n \n\nStep 2 - Click Enroll users in the upper right area, and then, in a pop-up window, select users or groups of users from the drop-down lists.\n\n \n\nStep 3 - When you have finished, click Enroll selected users and cohorts.\n\n \nHow to grade learners\u2019 assignments, IT_Helpdesk, To grade assignments, you need to choose the one you\u2019d like to begin with. You can do this in several ways, but let\u2019s go the most direct way and choose.\n\nStep 1 - Click on Grades in the left menu, and then find an activity you\u2019d like to grade in the row and click on it.\n\n \n\nYou\u2019ll get to the grading summary page with two options: View all submissions or Grade.\n\n \n\nStep 2 - To begin with, click \"View all submissions.\u201d After doing so, you\u2019ll see the list of all enrolled users and their submissions (or lack thereof). For more convenience, you can assign statuses, so it\u2019s always clear to you which work still needs marking or review.\n\n \n\nStep 3 - Click Grade if you\u2019re ready to begin reviewing some students\u2019 assignments. The grade book\u2019s interface allows you to leave annotations, text comments, mark with colors, and put various stamps as feedback.\n\nStep 4 - Enter the grade for the student\u2019s submission in the right panel, change the status.\n\n \n\nStep 5 - Click Save changes to quit or Save and show next to proceed.\n\n \nHow to message students, IT_Helpdesk, In Moodle, you can communicate with your learners and colleagues, just like in WhatsApp. In the upper ribbon, there\u2019s a bubble icon that opens the list of your contacts.\n\nYou can send private messages to users as well as group messages, which is a very convenient feature when you need to quickly discuss something, inform someone, or share an insight.\nClick the :speech_left: icon at the top right.\nHow to set up a course structure, IT_Helpdesk, In Moodle, four types of course formats define the outline\nSingle activity format\n\n Suitable when you have just one activity or resource to study. For example, a survey, a book, or a video lecture. Also, choose this format if you have a SCORM package.\n\nYou can use a single activity format to assign learners some readings\nTopics format\n\nOrganizes content into different sections (lessons, units, or whatever you prefer to call it).\n\nTopics are the most popular format for organizing an eLearning course\nWeekly format\n\nThis is similar to the topics format, but instead of units, you\u2019ll have weeks. This is a good option for you if you\u2019d like to set a regular learning pace for your students.\n\nYou can rename dates into Week 1, Week 2, and so forth, to make a course more reusable\nSocial format \n\nIf you choose this format, then you\u2019ll have a forum instead of traditional units. This is a good choice when you need informal learning and would like to encourage discussions between learners.\n\nWho said that learning platforms are only for e-courses? Forums are super useful for helping learners to get to know each other and allow productive informal communication\n\nStep 1 - Open the course shell you\u2019re going to fill with the learning content and activities.

With its help, you can collect and view marks and manually enter grades for offline activities.\n\nTo set up a grade book for a course:\n\nStep 1 - Click on the gear icon in the upper right and select Grade book setup. On a new page, you\u2019ll see the full list of graded items for the course.\n\n \n\n \n\nFor each item, there\u2019s a Weights column. The bigger the number, the more important the grade for performing this task (more on that in a minute).\n\nFor now, let\u2019s make grade book items l \u201cAdd category.\" In the demo course we use, there are three types of graded items, so we can create three categories for them:\n\n    Assignment\n\n    Quiz\n\n    Simulation\n\n \n\nIn your course, you can create any number of graded item types and as many categories as you need.\n\nStep 2 - After clicking Add category, give each created category a name and click Save changes.\n\n \n\nStep 3 - Now, move the items to their category by clicking the arrow icon on the left of the item\u2019s name.\n\nNow, when your items are organized, it\u2019s easier to assign the weights to each category. Let\u2019s say, we believe Assignment to be the most important category, so we\u2019d like to give it the largest weight. For example, it\u2019s 50. We tick a checkbox for Assignment and enter 50.\n\nAll the other weights are automatically adjusted, so the sum is 100, but you can define weights for the rest of the categories too \u2014 in our example, we put 30 and 20 for Quiz and Simulation correspondingly.\n\nIf you like, you can also manually define weights for each item within a category.\n\n \n\nStep 4 - When everything is ready, click Save changes in the left bottom.\n\n \nTrack activity completion, IT_Helpdesk, This guide explains how to view activity completion progress as a teacher using the activity completion report and as a student on the course home page.\n\n Activity completion must be enabled for the Moodle space and the appropriate activities.\nActivity completion icons\n\nActivity completion icons, or check boxes, give a visual indication of the current activity status. They provide information on whether this is manually by the participant or automatic based on criteria set by a user with editing rights.\n\nThe following icons appear on both the activity completion report and the course homepage.\n\n    :woman_teacher: Viewing the Activity completion report (for teachers)\n\n    :man_student: Viewing activity completion in a Moodle space (for students)\n\n:woman_teacher: Viewing the Activity completion report (for teachers)\n\nStep 1- Click on the :gear: gear icon  to open the actions menu.\n\nStep 2 - Select  'More...' at the bottom of the menu.\n\nStep 3 - Select Reports.\n\n Step 4 - Select 'Activity completion' in the Reports section.\n\nThe Activity completion report will open. Participants are listed in rows and activities with activity completion enabled appear as columns to the right. Each activity has a checkbox for each participant which gives a visual indication of their completion status.\n\n \n\nHover over the icons to see summary information about the participant, activity and current status e.g. 'Simon Singh, Mahara Assignment 101: Not completed'.\n\nUsers with editing rights are able to manually check and uncheck activity completion boxes in the report if required.\n:man_student: Viewing activity completion in a Moodle space (for students)\n\nStudents can track their progress from the course page. The icons appear on the right-hand side of activities that have had activity completion tracking enabled.\n\nIf there is no tick box then, completion tracking is not available for the activity.\n\nThe tick boxes will update when clicked on (for manual completion) or automatically when the relevant completion criteria are met e.g. when the activity is viewed, an entry is added, or a submission is made depending on the type of activity.

Why? Let\u2019s look at a case scenario below to better understand. \r\n\r\nFor example; You are an agent for Academic Administration service desk and you receive an email enquiry to your work email inbox from a student. When you forward this email to admin@apu.edu.my, it will create a ticket on Virtual Help Centre - Academic Administration. The reporter of this ticket enquiry will be you because the email forwarder (sender) to admin@apu.edu.my is from your email address that created ticket instead of student email. \r\n\r\nEven though you can change the reporter after ticket creation on Agent Portal from your email to student email, the student will not know that you have created a ticket on behalf of the student on Virtual Help Centre - Academic Administration, only if you reply to the ticket. The first time a ticket is created on Virtual Help Centre, it will send email notification to reporter that a ticket have been created but, in this case it will send this notification to you because originally this ticket was created with your email address (email forwarder). See the screenshot of ticket history below.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see that ticket was originally created by ismail@staffemail.apu.edu.my and the user received email notification that a ticket have been created. Later, this ticket reporter is changed from ismail@staffemail.apu.edu.my to Mohammad Reza Ganji and as mentioned above the new reporter will not receive notification because Mohammad Reza Ganji is not original reporter of this ticket. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we recommend to use Jira Cloud Oulook add-in to create ticket on behalf of the reporter (email sender) to avoid any conflict about reporter. Follow this guide to know; how to make an email enquiry to a ticket in Virtual Help Centre from Outlook using Jira Cloud add-in.\nHow to Create ticket from Outlook?, IT_Helpdesk, If you receive an enquiry from student/parent/guardian/staff in your work email inbox then, you should change this email enquiry to a ticket and respond to enquiry via Agent Portal. It is basically creating ticket on behalf of the reporter (email sender). The following steps will guide you on how to change an email enquiry to a ticket on Virtual Help Centre using Jira Cloud add-in on Outlook;\r\n\r\nStep 1 - Open Outlook application on your computer.\r\n\r\nStep 2 - Go to the email enquiry send to your work email inbox.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 3 - Click on Home tab.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 4 - Find Jira Cloud add-in on your Home toolbar. Click on Create Issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 5 - Within the Outlook app, Jira Cloud window will slide-in and you have to select and enter information in the fields related to the enquiry. Fill in the required field related to the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 6 - Select the service desk (Project).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you click on this field it will suggest you service desk(s) if you are agent in more than one service desk, make sure you select the correct one related to the ticket.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 7 - Select the Request type.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure ticket is created in the correct  helpdesk project and request type. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 8 - Enter the email address of the reporter of the issue/enquiry. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt will auto suggest the reporter as it captures the email sender (reporter) and recipient.

An alternative route for guidance and support is through APSpace > More > Help Centre. This guide is intended to streamline the process of opening a ticket for your convenience.\r\n\r\nIn terms of software compatibility, Microsoft SQL Server with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) has an equivalent alternative in Azure SQL Edge and Azure Data Studio, while Visual Studio IDE has counterparts in Visual Studio for Mac (with no support for C, C++) and Visual Studio Code with limited C, C++ support.\r\n\r\nIBM SPSS Amos is currently unsupported, and SOLIDWORKS lacks virtualized support but is compatible with native environments. Microsoft Project and Microsoft Visio are unsupported on virtualized platforms but supported in native environments. SQL Accounting, SQL Payroll, Sage UBS Accounting, Sage UBS Inventory and Billing, and Sage UBS Payroll are all unsupported in virtualized environments but supported natively.\r\n\r\nNotably, TASM (or any assembler) lacks support across the board. It is unsupported natively, virtually, and on MacOS.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that an unofficial script exists for Microsoft SQL Server and SSMS installation, tested on the UTM environment. SOLIDWORKS shows no evidence of missing features or issues when running on ARM64, and TASM assembler can be emulated via DOSBox using a Visual Studio Code extension, with no information on any missing instruction set.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed installation guidelines and related pages, users can refer to the specified links provided in the guide.\nHow to access SAP remotely?, IT_Helpdesk, Only IBPSES \u2013 Integrated Business Process with SAP ERP System module \u2013 students enrolled in SAP  can access this URL remotely using the link below:\r\n\r\nhttp://s71lp1.ucc.in.tum.de:8000/sap/bc/gui/sap/its/webgui?sap-client=350\r\n\r\nNote: the credential will be provided to you by instructor/lecturer.\r\n\r\nSAP\r\nInstallation Guideline for SAP GUI 7.50 (Windows 11), IT_Helpdesk, Installation guideline for SAP GUI 7.50.

Occasional errors may occur as Outlook will need to sync with the Exchange server to process these changes.\r\n\r\nPlease plan ahead and do this when you are not using Outlook, ideally at the beginning of the year. \r\n\r\nStep 1: Right click on Archive, select New Folder.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Enter the year name. \r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Click on the search bar on top, then click on the down arrow to show the filter menu.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 4: Change the Received date to the start and end of the year you want to archive.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 5: Examine the search results.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot all search results will be populated on the first search. Here\u2019s how to tell if Outlook haven\u2019t finish searching all mails within the year:\r\n\r\nCheck the bottom left corner on the number of results found. Usually, all results count should not be a multiple of 100, but instead at an arbitrary number like 2,123.\r\n\r\n\r\nScroll to the bottom of the search results. If Outlook is still searching, it means not all results are populated.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 6: Click on one of the emails, then press Ctrl + A to select all emails. \r\n\r\nStep 7: Right click on one of the emails, select Move, then choose the archive folder to move to.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d34ccad-02a5-4a8f-b6c6-a109b0648610": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d34ccad-02a5-4a8f-b6c6-a109b0648610", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "c5c0a970-4473-4736-bdc3-7dfb3c2ea4fc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "94464f0f3ab42cbf65b6c4db83d044b090514d3cd3e8b07d2006e616d93c4808"}, "3": {"node_id": "5bb37d3b-d158-4c74-8f2b-923af51ef27f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f40b1671b040d70cb15eb0bc9a665513e5db7ad9d4e136c8b3c2a3ebe46a6d9"}}, "hash": "da95a120a19a7d058174061e467c53c17507dc0d0143371f72180dbbc8631e63", "text": "Archiving by year using this method will move all emails to the year folder, regardless of its original folder location.

This Outlook Data File contains your messages and other Outlook items and is saved on your onedrive. \r\n\r\nIf you want to back up the message folders to Onedrive, you can automatically move or delete older items with AutoArchive or export the items to a .pst file that you can restore later as needed and use by importing.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Select File > Open & Export > Import/Export.\r\n\r\nPST location\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 2: Select Export to a file, and then select Next.\r\n\r\n\r\nExport File\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 3: Select Outlook Data File (.pst), and select Next.\r\n\r\nExport to data file\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 4: Select the mail folder you want to back up and select Next.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail folders\r\n \r\n\r\nStep 5: Choose a location on Onedrive and name for your backup file, and then select Finish.\r\n\r\nStep 6: If you want to ensure no one has access to your files, enter and confirm a password, and then select OK.\r\n\r\nResult: The messages that you keep in a .pst file are no different from other messages. You can forward, reply, or search through the stored messages as you do with other messages.\nCan I access my email during the migration?, IT_Helpdesk, No, during the migration period your email will not be accessible.\nCan I use my current mobile email apps?

Unfortunately for me, this method did not work and even now my emails going to junk folder - Outlook 2013. Can anyone tell me how to stop internal emails going to junk folder office 365?\r\n\r\nLegitimate Emails going to Junk folder\r\nHaving legitimate emails going to Junk folder is no less annoying than having spam email in your Inbox. Have a look at the reasons behind this problem briefly and then move to solution part. This issue occurs when Microsoft 365 considers emails from trusted sources as spam. This results in legitimate emails ending up in Junk folder. During this situation, users have to check junk folder to see if it contains any legitimate emails. To get rid internal emails going to junk folder Microsoft 365 issue, users can apply these techniques.\r\n\r\nManual Methods to Stop Emails Going to Spam Folder\r\nThere are a number of ways to stop legitimate emails going to Junk. In this segment, readers will learn these methods to stop internal emails going to junk folder in Microsoft 365 account.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Configure Spam Filter Policy: First, users should verify \u2018Advanced Spam Filter\u2019 policies to check if an entire domain has been blocked. If yes, then all emails coming from that particular domain will go to Junk. Users can disable advanced spam filtering options that cause such problem. Users can also create \u2018Safe Senders List\u2019 in Microsoft 365 to stop Microsoft 365 email going to spam by going to Settings>> Options>> Block or Allow. Note that Exchange Online Protection (EOP) does not keep track of domains. It keeps only senders and recipients.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Using Directory Synchronization: This technique is applicable only to active staff and students. Usually, Microsoft 365 email users are by default protected by Exchange Online Protection (EOP). In case of EOP-only subscribers, they can use director synchronization to fix this problem. Directory synchronization allows users to synchronize their own settings with EOP services. Thus EOP will have access to user\u2019s \u2018Safe Senders List\u2019 and function accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Setting Connection Filter\u2019s IP Allow list: To fix false negative issue of Microsoft 365 emails to Junk, users can add senders\u2019 IP addresses to IP allow list of connection filter. When users enable \u2018Safe List Only\u2019 option, they receive emails sent by the enlisted senders only to their inbox. In this case, adding IP address cannot eliminate the problem completely. As Microsoft 365 email going to spam can\u2019t be relinquish with IP.\r\n\r\nHow to add an IP address to IP Allow list of Connection Filter\r\nStep 1: By extracting header of emails sent by preferred senders from Outlook or OWA.\r\n\r\nBy following the manual in \u2018Use the EAC to change the default connection filter policy.\r\n\r\nBy manually finding IP address with Message Analyzer tab of Remote Connectivity.

If ContactsTrusted value is true, user trusts both Contacts and Safe Senders.TrustedSendersAndDomains value shows contents of the user\u2019s Safe Senders Lists.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Using Safe Senders List: Web Outlook users can use this method to stop emails from ending up in Junk folder. If there is a message with yellow colored safety tip, it means the email is in junk folder. Users can check the header of email whether it still contains SFV:SKN or SFV:NSPM stamp.

You are advised to use audio with screen sharing if bandwidth is an issue.\r\n\r\nYou are advised not to play any video during the screen sharing with audio mode. The screen sharing is ideally used to beam the presentation slides along with living demos (if any). If there are any videos to be played, do share the video link with students and get them to view from their side.

After 7th July 2021, recordings of your Microsoft Teams meetings will be stored either in Teams Channel or OneDrive which previously were automatically stored in Microsoft Stream (Ref: Use OneDrive for Business and SharePoint for meeting recordings - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Docs ).  As a result, location of the meeting recording will be changed as follows:\r\n\r\nRecordings for Scheduled Meetings in a Teams Channel\r\n For meetings scheduled in a Teams Channel including your online/remote classes, or started using Meet Now in a Teams Channel, your recorded lecture videos will be stored in the files section of that Channel under a folder called Recordings (Eg: Teams name - Channel name/Documents/Recordings) .It will be available to all members of that particular Team. Lecturers are responsible to  publish/share the link of recorded lecture videos on relevant section in Moodle Platform and  ensure  the videos are accessible not less than 6 month from the published date.\r\n\r\nRecordings for Scheduled Meetings NOT in a Teams Channel\r\nRecordings of regular meetings not scheduled in a Teams Channel, including 1-on-1 calls and multi-person chats, will be stored in a folder called Recordings in the OneDrive of the person who started the recording (eg: recorder's OneDrive for Business/Recordings). The recording will automatically be shared with all APU  participants of the meeting including students. If there were external participants to the meeting, a link to the recording must be manually shared with them via the normal OneDrive/SharePoint sharing mechanism.\r\n\r\nWhy the change?\r\nThis change brings some improvements to the way videos are stored and shared:\r\n\r\nRecordings will be available directly in OneDrive/SharePoint instead of requiring accessing to the Stream portal. OneDrive and SharePoint provide simpler sharing options than the Stream portal.  \r\n\r\nProvides the ability to share recordings with external users.\r\n\r\nSaved recordings will be made available more quickly than those currently being saved to Stream.\r\n\r\nFAQ - Frequently Asked Questions \r\nQuestions\r\n\r\nAnswers\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\n\r\nAnswers\r\n\r\nHow will my storage quota be impacted?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8325bd71-d194-4e93-92be-9e9696756f0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8325bd71-d194-4e93-92be-9e9696756f0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ce56877-32a5-4f97-baef-b8350c5589da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c33cf8cbdd42524a6f83b5ee4cfa8139d45c3bb069d7c7a66515451f2c711041"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5fa6b09-d87a-4f9d-b9e1-b967d0885e1f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d874edcd72e873c5c7e454aa4328dff655b51b1191f93dfc569e362faf732ef2"}}, "hash": "c955397899fffa740782bcc5e5d2535b944ca8d468e8645eb6c6d57ea7be8b31", "text": "Teams meeting recording files live will be stored on your OneDrive@APU and SharePoint which, quota for those services can  be increased if required .\r\n\r\nWhen Stream files (such as recordings) are stored in SharePoint/OneDrive, how is it decided where they go?

This access has been made possible due to the institution's acquisition of licenses, enabling students and staff to use these services free of charge.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is crucial to be aware that this access will undergo changes upon your departure from APU. After your official graduation date, which is indicated on your diploma or degree, you will retain access to Microsoft 365 as part of the active APU student group for approximately one year. During this temporary extension, your access to email and IT services will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nOnce this period expires, your access to all Microsoft 365 applications, including Outlook, OneDrive, and Teams, will be revoked, leading to the unavailability of your files and emails. To retain access to Microsoft 365 beyond this point, you will have the option to subscribe to the service directly from Microsoft.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you do not intend to purchase a subscription to continue using Microsoft 365, it is highly recommended that you take proactive measures to safeguard your files.

The tool uses multicast packets to measure network performance by sending test traffic to multiple destinations on the network and measuring the response time. Additionally, some network devices, such as wireless access points and switches, may use multicast packets for internal communication related to Teams traffic. As a result, the total amount of airtime available which is fixed due to nature Wi-Fi Technology, can run out (or reach 100% utilization).\r\n\r\nLimited Wi-Fi airtime:\r\nUnlike wired network, Wi-Fi is a shared (and half-duplex) medium, meaning that all devices operating on the same channel must compete (or contend) for the same limited airtime, and only one device can \u201ctalk\u201d at any given moment. Therefore, you need to wait for your turn to send or receive data via Wi-Fi,where only one device \u201ctalks\u201d at a time, and must contend with each other for their opportunity to transmit or receive. Obviously, the more devices connected to Microsoft Teams via Wi-Fi, the more contention occurs, which can slow down the network.\r\n\r\nWi-Fi Bandwidth limitations\r\n The amount of data that can be transmitted over a wireless network is limited by the Wi-Fi bandwidth available. When many people are using the same network simultaneously, they are all competing for the same bandwidth, over a limited airtime which can slow down the network. This is particularly true if multiple people are trying to stream video such as Microsoft Teams or upload/download large files at the same time.\r\n\r\nCongestion\r\nWhen many people are using the same wireless network, the network can become congested, which can slow down speeds. This can be particularly true if multiple people are using bandwidth-intensive applications, such as video conferencing like Microsoft Teams.\r\n\r\nOutdated hardware\r\nIf the students are using outdated hardware, such as old laptops or smartphones, they may not be able to take advantage of the latest Wi-Fi technologies such as Wi-Fi 6, which can result in slower speeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a summary, Microsoft Teams is a platform that enables video conferencing and collaboration. To join a Teams call, only one device in a room or classroom needs to be connected to the platform. This prevents audio interference and helps to avoid slowing down the Wi-Fi for other online activities, like taking notes on Microsoft Note.

The recommended method for the best experience is to access VirtualLab@APU using Horizon Client. However, if you don't have permission to install Horizon Client, you can still access VirtualLab@APU through HTML Access.\r\n\r\nFunctionality:\r\n\r\nHorizon Client:\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: Requires the installation of Horizon Client, necessitating administrative permission.\r\nPerformance: Offers a smoother performance compared to HTML Access.\r\nFile Transfer: Supports shared folders, USB redirection, and upload to OneDrive.\r\nMulti-display: Supported for enhanced workspace.\r\nWindows Key Action: Direct input by pressing \u229e WIN.\r\nAdditional Functionalities: Provides additional support for Skype and Microsoft Teams, supports multimedia and browser redirection, and utilizes PCoIP and Microsoft RDP protocols.\r\nDisplay Scaling: Allows synchronized key locks (CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, SCROLL LOCK).\r\nHTML Access:\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: Requires only a web browser, eliminating the need for administrative permission.\r\nPerformance: Generally slower compared to Horizon Client.\r\nFile Transfer: Supports upload to OneDrive.\r\nMulti-display: Supported for extended workspace.\r\nWindows Key Action: Simulated by pressing CTRL + \u229e WIN.\r\nAdditional Functionalities: Limited compared to Horizon Client, lacking additional support for Skype and Microsoft Teams, and some multimedia and browser redirection features.\r\nDisplay Scaling: Supported.\r\nIn summary, while both methods allow access to VirtualLab@APU, Horizon Client offers a more feature-rich and smoother experience, especially in terms of performance and additional functionalities. HTML Access serves as an alternative, more accessible option without the need for installation permissions, albeit with some limitations in functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the minimum bandwidth required to use VirtualLab@APU?, IT_Helpdesk, \r\nVirtualLab@APU Bandwidth Guidelines:\r\n\r\nVirtualLab@APU employs VMware's PCoIP and Blast Extreme display protocols to adapt to varying latency and bandwidth conditions. The required bandwidth varies based on different use cases, distinguishing between office productivity and video streaming. VMware recommends handling bandwidth ranging from 100 Kbps to 2 Mbps for each user. Here's a breakdown of the expected minimum bandwidth for various use cases:\r\n\r\nAverage Bandwidth:\r\n50 - 150 Kbps: Basic office applications (no video and 3D graphics)\r\n400 - 600 Kbps: Multi-displays, Microsoft Office, and programming software (with simple 3D graphics and Aero)\r\n500 Kbps - 1 Mbps: Software with bursts of display changes, as seen in multimedia designing and CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software\r\n>2 Mbps: Video streaming (Higher video resolution and/or frame rates will substantially increase the required bandwidth)\r\nUsers are encouraged to check their internet connection using speedtest.net for a general assessment. For a more accurate result on expected bandwidth while using VirtualLab@APU, users should follow specific settings before testing:\r\n\r\nTest Server: Maxis, Subang Jaya (Closest server to APU)\r\nConnections: Single (Simulates VPN connection)\r\nThese settings ensure a more precise evaluation of the expected bandwidth.

Since the whole purpose of our mail server is to just relay all messages to Office365 it is not necessary to configure external domain.\r\n\r\nOnce installation completes we need to configure postfix; open /etc/postfix/main.cf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf\r\nFor the relayhost add smtp.office365.com and port 587\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrelayhost = [smtp.office365.com]:587\r\nSince we will be using this mail server locally we want to protect it by saying that we only accept connections from localhost. So modify this two setting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8\r\ninet_interfaces = loopback-only\r\nNormally you want to use secure connection to Office365 so it is necessary to configure postfix to use TLS. Add this code at the end of the config file and save the file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsmtp_use_tls = yes\r\nsmtp_always_send_ehlo = yes\r\nsmtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes\r\nsmtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd\r\nsmtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous\r\nsmtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous\r\nsmtp_tls_security_level = encrypt\r\nsmtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic\r\nsmtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt\r\nNext we need to configure the sasl_passwd and generic files.\r\n\r\nThe sasl_passwd holds information for the Office365 account used to relay the emails. Create the file by typing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd\r\nand add this line to the file\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[smtp.office365.com]:587 username@yourdomain:office365password\r\nChange the username@yourdomain with your account and office365password with the account password and save the file.\r\n\r\nNext we need to set correct file permissions and hash the file for use in postfix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd\r\nsudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd\r\nsudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd\r\nNext we need to configure generic file in order to be able to send emails as a valid user (this is required for Office365).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsudo nano /etc/postfix/generic\r\nand add this two lines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nroot@localdomain user@domain.com\r\n@localdomain user@domain.com\r\nsubstitute user@domain.com with your Office365 account used previously.

Yet for the time being passwords remain our primary means of verifying the identity of individuals before granting access to services or data. This document details some upcoming changes to how APIIT Education Group maintains digital credentials and discusses some planned future enhancements.\r\n\r\nIt is worth briefly discussing what passwords do. Passwords don\u2019t intrinsically provide any security; rather, a password is a secret that (in theory) is known only to an individual. By providing the password when prompted, you as an individual are identified; that is, the combination of the username and password tells the system who you are\u2014and because the password is a secret known only to you, it verifies that you are who you say you are.\r\n\r\nCreating Strong Passwords\r\n\r\nA strong password has usually meant one that is difficult to guess.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54f94882-c3bc-455c-996a-005157b6f586": {"__data__": {"id_": "54f94882-c3bc-455c-996a-005157b6f586", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "5371b4d6-4981-4916-96a0-3fd16bf763ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8de6e026bc2b31110c4eb6d1cd96c7eafc4158e6f5364c8d6a33b1c2cd20069"}, "3": {"node_id": "28d5b527-67a0-4351-92ab-26fec7957f93", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "93bcb071eec3d49b569f73e9815373597b9baa6d3d295dc857d4448ce97e8bc2"}}, "hash": "2170e6bfaabb00a232b9853f7473b4186803fbd1ae95580f82019300222daad1", "text": "Yet with the advent of powerful computing, it has become possible to make repeated guesses at a password, thousands if not millions of times per minute.1 The effect of this is that an ordinary 8-character password, by itself, offers limited protection against hacking. The standard approach to addressing this is to require passwords of greater and greater complexity and length\u2014thus leading to more forgotten or mistyped passwords, an increased burden on helpdesks, and user frustration and anger.\r\n\r\nWhy Bother?\r\n\r\nFirst, passwords do get stolen, and they get stolen in a number of different ways. Additionally, we regularly see brute force2 attempts to log into an account using commonly used passwords. By requiring the use of strong passwords, we are attempting to slow the ability to use the stolen password long enough for us to detect its use, detect its theft, or lower our attractiveness as a target.3\r\n\r\nAchieving this does not require absurdly complex passwords, but it does require the use of longer passwords or passphrases. For example, using a well-known method for evaluating passwords,4 we see that the apparently very strong password &xy90UJ! would take ~7 years to crack; whereas the much easier to remember passphrase rain Spain falls plain would take centuries to crack. Here are a few more samples in this table:\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it is obvious that long, comprehensible, and memorable sentences make for much stronger credentials than traditional passwords, it is compelling to ask, \u201cwhy are we still using traditional passwords?\u201d The answer is historical more than technical. Because of the long use of passwords, many applications assume that the password \u201cends\u201d when it encounters the first space character. Thus \u201cRosebud Was The Sled\u201d will be seen as merely \u201cRosebud,\u201d a word found in dictionaries and instantly crackable.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to ask why, if a password can resist being cracked for a century, it would ever need to be changed. First, note that those estimates for crack time make a number of assumptions about how the password is stored. If you use the same password at APIIT Education Group that you use for a poorly secured website or game site, the thief may be able to simply read your password\u2014no cracking necessary.  Thus it becomes a balancing act\u2014we require you to change your password periodically based on a reasonable estimate of how long it might take to crack it. While it would be possible to calculate a unique password expiration period for everyone, supporting this (and explaining it) can get complicated. Therefore, our policy will be to require annual password changes for shorter passwords, and biennial changes (every two years) for longer passwords and passphrases.\r\n\r\nSecond, despite being a violation of policy and best practice, we know from experience that people do occasionally share a password. By periodically requiring the password to change, we effectively reset that decision.\r\n\r\nUltimately, passwords are like stoves, to quote Mark Twain:\r\n\r\nWe do not remember the exact date of the invention of stoves, but it was some years ago. Since then mankind have been tormented once a year, by the difficulties that beset the task of putting them up, and getting the pipes fixed.5\r\n\r\nGoing Forward: Password and Passphrase Creation and Maintenance\r\n\r\nIn summary, LTS is modifying the rules for creating and changing passwords and passphrases. These changes are designed to encourage longer and easier-to-remember passphrases. This represents a significant increase to the protection of campus accounts, systems, and services.\r\n\r\nPassphrases are over 14 characters in length and may be formed using only upper- and lowercase characters (a minimum of one of each). These will expire after a period of two years. For technical reasons, no passphrase may be over 30 characters in length. We recommend using a minimum of four unrelated words separated by spaces.\r\n\r\nPasswords must be between 10 and 14 characters. Passwords 14 characters or fewer in length will require the usual assortment of at least one character from each character set: digits (0-9), non-alphabetic symbols (!@#$%); uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). Dictionary words and commonly used passwords are also not permitted to be part of the password.\r\n\r\nIn no case may the user\u2019s username or last password be part of either a password or a passphrase.\r\n\r\nThe following table summarizes the above rule set.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28d5b527-67a0-4351-92ab-26fec7957f93": {"__data__": {"id_": "28d5b527-67a0-4351-92ab-26fec7957f93", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4e59f32c-23b1-4049-a357-c2c70c20d003", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd748440e9d2ba21c1557a530a9cebf25595446d661ff20312e10f6930cc378c"}, "2": {"node_id": "54f94882-c3bc-455c-996a-005157b6f586", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2170e6bfaabb00a232b9853f7473b4186803fbd1ae95580f82019300222daad1"}, "3": {"node_id": "b693a1e0-d416-4c14-b115-025390fd41aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "107baa66fdf768f651a2c34eac93e2f66e13ad7ec3039679ee753f8eebcac073"}}, "hash": "93bcb071eec3d49b569f73e9815373597b9baa6d3d295dc857d4448ce97e8bc2", "text": "The following table summarizes the above rule set.\r\n\r\nChanging your password\r\n\r\nOne of the largest problems facing institutions that require a periodic password change is assisting individuals who have forgotten their passwords.

Think of it as \u201cserverless\u201d web hosting for your Python apps. That means infinite scaling, zero downtime, zero maintenance \u2013 and at a fraction of the cost of your current deployments! If you\u2019ve got a Python web app (including Django and Flask apps), it\u2019s as easy as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n$ pip install zappa\r\n$ zappa init\r\n$ zappa deploy\r\nand now you\u2019re server-less! Wow!\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean \u201cserverless\u201d?\r\n\r\nOkay, so there still is a server \u2013 but it only has a 40-millisecond life cycle! Serverless in this case means \u201cwithout any permanent infrastructure.\u201d With a traditional HTTP server, the server is online 24/7, processing requests one by one as they come in. If the queue of incoming requests grows too large, some requests will time out. With Zappa, each request is given its own virtual HTTP \u201cserver\u201d by Amazon API Gateway. AWS handles the horizontal scaling automatically, so no requests ever time out. Each request then calls your application from a memory cache in AWS Lambda and returns the response via Python\u2019s WSGI interface. After your app returns, the \u201cserver\u201d dies. Better still, with Zappa you only pay for the milliseconds of server time that you use, so it\u2019s many orders of magnitude cheaper than VPS/PaaS hosts like Linode or Heroku \u2013 and in most cases, it\u2019s completely free. Plus, there\u2019s no need to worry about load balancing or keeping servers online ever again. It\u2019s great for deploying serverless microservices with frameworks like Flask and Bottle, and for hosting larger web apps and CMSes with Django. Or, you can use any WSGI-compatible app you like! You probably don\u2019t need to change your existing applications to use it, and you\u2019re not locked into using it. Zappa also lets you build hybrid event-driven applications that can scale to trillions of events a year with no additional effort on your part! You also get free SSL certificates, global app deployment, API access management, automatic security policy generation, precompiled C-extensions, auto keep-warms, oversized Lambda packages, and many other exclusive features! And finally, Zappa is super easy to use. You can deploy your application with a single command out of the box! Awesome! To use Zappa in BitBucket pipeline you need to have a file named zappa_settings.json in the root of the repository.\r\n\r\nThe deployment is in AWS environemnt (most probably) as so you need to have the networking settings in the zappa file. That includes subnet ID and security group. You MUST request a new security group for each project. This is necessary as the other security groups attached to database or EC2 or other resources are relying on security group ID.

Phishing attacks can take many forms, but they all share a common goal \u2013 getting you to share sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card information, or bank account details. Although we maintain controls to help protect our networks and computers from cyber threats, we rely on you to be our first line of defence. We\u2019ve outlined a few different types of phishing attacks to watch out for:\r\n\r\nPhishing: In this type of attack, hackers impersonate a real company to obtain your login credentials. You may receive an e-mail asking you to verify your account details with a link that takes you to an imposter login screen that delivers your information directly to the attackers.\r\n\r\nSpear Phishing: Spear phishing is a more sophisticated phishing attack that includes customized information that makes the attacker seem like a legitimate source. They may use your name and phone number and refer to APU  in the e-mail to trick you into thinking they have a connection to you, making you more likely to click a link or attachment that they provide.\r\n\r\nWhaling: Whaling is a popular ploy aimed at getting you to transfer money or send sensitive information to an attacker via email by impersonating a real university staff. Using a fake domain that appears similar to ours, they look like normal emails from a high-level official of the company, typically the Head of School or your lecturer, and ask you for sensitive information (including usernames and passwords).\r\n\r\nShared Document Phishing: You may receive an e-mail that appears to come from file-sharing site like SharePoint alerting you that a document has been shared with you. The link provided in these e-mails will take you to a fake login page that mimics the real login page and will steal your account credentials.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhat You Can Do\r\n To avoid these phishing schemes, please observe the following email best practices:\r\n\r\nDo not click on links or attachments from senders that you do not recognize. Be especially wary of .zip or other compressed or executable file types.\r\n\r\nDo not provide sensitive personal information (like usernames and passwords) over email.\r\n\r\nWatch for email senders that use suspicious or misleading domain names.\r\n\r\nInspect URLs carefully to make sure they\u2019re legitimate and not imposter sites.\r\n\r\nDo not try to open any shared document that you\u2019re not expecting to receive.\r\n\r\nIf you can\u2019t tell if an email is legitimate or not, please  send email to asssit@apu.edu.my to allow us to verify.\r\n\r\nBe especially cautious when opening attachments or clicking links if you receive an email containing a warning banner indicating that it originated from an external source.\nUpdate your Windows PC, IT_Helpdesk, Windows Update automatically installs important updates as they become available.

If you are under the Daily Parking scheme, failing to complete your entry-exit cycle within the same day will result in your balance being deducted for multiple daily parking rates, as if you have parked overnight.
