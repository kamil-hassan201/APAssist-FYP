What are the New Class Code Structure?,Academic_Administration,This new structure was rolled out in early 2021. The following is a guide to understand new class code for both lecturers and academic administration. Cluster ___ ModuleCode-ClassType ___ ClassStartDate APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14 For example: APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14 APP___AAPP004-4-2-JP-LAB-1___2020-11-14 APP___ AAPP004-4-2-JP-L-1___2020-11-14 APP___ AAPP004-4-2-JP-T1___2020-11-14 :star2: Benefits for Lecturers Automatic Class Code Detection in Attendix (no manual selection required) - Read about here Different Class Code for LAB and Tutorial (no manual selection required) Future report to understand how many class codes have been taught during the year(LAB-16). :star2: Benefits for Academic Administration Automatic Class Code Generation Automatic Class Creation in SIS (no more event list) Automatic Student Enrollment to the Classes Automatic Intake Grouping of the Students Sending Notification to Students
Why cluster code has been added to the class code?,Academic_Administration,"Because the same module being taught at the exact start date can carry the same lecture, tutorial, or lab class number. As so, the cluster is at the beginning of the code to ensure there are no duplicate codes created in GIMS."
Why haven't we added the intakes to the class code?,Academic_Administration,"It seems like you're discussing the structure of class codes and the challenges associated with incorporating intakes into the class code. Here are some considerations and a revised example: Unique Class Codes: It's important that class codes are unique, especially when used across different systems, to avoid confusion. However, as you pointed out, when intakes change, it may lead to changes in the class codes. One possible approach is to include a timestamp or academic year/semester to ensure uniqueness without altering the code too frequently. Short and Manageable Class Codes: Class codes should be short and manageable, especially for modules with a high number of intakes. One way to achieve this is to use abbreviations or acronyms for module names and include intake-related information as a suffix. Here's a revised example using your provided data: Original Intakes: APU2102SE APU2102CT Original Class Code: APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14 Revised Class Codes for Separated Intakes (Week 3 or 4): APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14___CT APP___CT042-3-1-IDB-LAB-1___2020-06-14___SE By including intake information as a suffix, you can distinguish between different intakes while maintaining a stable base class code. The inclusion of the academic year and semester also ensures uniqueness. For the second part of your question, it appears you want to reformat a list of intakes and module codes in a more readable way. Here's the reformatted list: Intakes: UC2F2102BM APD1F2103CE APD1F2103CGD APD1F2103CS APD1F2103CS(CYB) APD1F2103CS(DF) APD1F2103CS(IS) APD1F2103EEE APD1F2103IT APD1F2103ME APD1F2103MMT APD1F2103PE APD1F2103SE APU1F2103CE APU1F2103CGD APU1F2103CS APU1F2103CS(CYB) APU1F2103CS(DF) APU1F2103CS(IS) APU1F2103EEE APU1F2103IT APU1F2103ME APU1F2103MMT APU1F2103PE APU1F2103SE APU1F2103ACS APD1F2103ACS APU1F2103AF APD1F2103AF APU1F2103BAF APD1F2103BAF APU1F2103BAF(FT) APD1F2103BAF(FT) APU1F2103BM APD1F2103BM APU1F2103HRM APU1F2103IBM APD1F2103IBM APU1F2103MKT APD1F2103MKT APU1F2103TRM APD1F2103TRM APU1F2103IR APD1F2103IR APU1F2103MCS APD1F2103MCS APD1F2103TE APU1F2103TE APD1F2103ME Module Code: MPU3173-MLY3(FS)-L-2 I hope this formatting is clearer and more readable for your needs."

What do we mean by Extenuating Circumstances (EC)?,Academic_Administration,"These are normally circumstances that have prevented you either from demonstrating or acquiring, the skills, knowledge, or competencies associated with a particular module(s). These could be defined as either: Unforeseeable e.g. you suffered a broken arm just prior to an examination and could not write, or Unpreventable e.g. you did everything in your power to ensure the safety of your work, by keeping back up discs, but a house fire destroyed everything or you are required to leave the local area for medical treatment which cannot be postponed or need to  return to your local area for visa requirements. A claim form should be completed by any student affected by extenuating circumstances. The claims for extenuating circumstances with supporting evidence must be submitted no more than 3 working days after the extenuating circumstances occurred."
How do I submit EC?,Academic_Administration,"You can submit EC Online from the following link – e-Forms (Forms & Applications). APSpace > More > e-Forms.

What else do I need to do submit EC?,Academic_Administration,"It is your responsibility to supply the appropriate evidence to support your claim. Supporting documents/evidences that are in a language other than English or Bahasa Melayu must be accompanied by a certified translation of the original documents. Where your EC concerns sickness, a medical certificate/full medical report from a registered medical practitioner from clinic or  Government Hospital will be required. You should not submit a claim where a single seminar, lecture or lab work has been missed due to  illness. If you join an award part-way through the semester, late entry will not be viewed as an extenuating circumstance. This would not be considered to be an appropriate basis upon which to submit a claim   for extenuating circumstances."
What are the documents needed to support my EC?,Academic_Administration,"All requests for consideration of extenuating circumstances must typically be substantiated with relevant and independent documentary evidence. The evidence required for various unforeseen circumstances is as follows: Illness: Medical Certificate or a Letter from a registered medical practitioner from a private or government clinic/hospital. Death in the Family: Death Certificate. Accident/Robbery: Police Report. Visa Issues: Flight tickets and visa documents. Applications for extenuating circumstances are further reinforced when accompanied by endorsements from University staff members such as Academic Mentors, Programme Leaders, or Lecturers. It is important to note that self-certification of your own circumstances or evidence not provided by an independent authority will not be accepted by the University."
What grounds will not normally be considered as extenuating circumstances?,Academic_Administration,"You may not normally claim extenuating circumstances on the basis that your academic performance has been affected by family, financial or other lifestyle problems. In particular, extenuating circumstances cannot normally be claimed on any of the following grounds (the list is not exhaustive): Normally, the second or subsequent attempt of an element of assessment (exam or coursework) where an EC has   been upheld for a previous attempt Inadequate planning, organisation or management on your part, this may include: Development of a solution taking longer than anticipated Learning a programming language taking longer than anticipated Technical difficulties in integrating elements of a solution, etc Timetabling of coursework or examinations Misreading of assessment dates and times Personal computer or printer problems Minor illnesses, such as a cold Holidays or social occasions Transport problems Moving house Normal work patterns and pressures of employment Pregnancy (unless unexpected complications occur) If you are uncertain whether your claim might be legitimate, please discuss this with your Academic Mentor or  your Programme Leader. Any student who is alleged to have submitted falsified evidence in support of a claim of extenuating circumstances will be referred for consideration under the terms of the APU/APIIT Academic Dishonesty Regulations."
What should I include when I explain my circumstances?,Academic_Administration,"The circumstances must have been at the same time as the acquisition of the skill/knowledge/competency or the assessment of the module. If you have missed an assignment through ill health, then the illness must coincide   with the preparation, writing or deadline of that assessment. If you are a part-time student and have been unable to submit your work by the original deadline date because, for instance, you were required by your employer to work away from home for several weeks at the time you should have submitted your work, you must provide a letter from your employer confirming this. The circumstances should be detailed concisely. The Extenuating Circumstances Claims Office should be provided with the essential information to enable it to make an informed decision regarding the circumstances."
Which kind supporting evidance I have to submit during my illness?,Academic_Administration,"Please note that minor illnesses or ailments will not normally be accepted as valid reasons for extenuating circumstances. Unless you have seen a Doctor or Counsellor at the time of your illness or problem, it is unlikely that your claim will be accepted. For instance, a letter from a Specialist Medical Centre or Government Hospital stating that you were seen on a particular date and told him/her that you HAD BEEN ill will not normally be accepted."
What if I have no evidence?,Academic_Administration,"A claim is unlikely to be upheld without appropriate supporting evidence. You should review the circumstances   and try to find an independent person, organization or support service that can provide verification. A member of staff may be able to provide a supporting statement."
Who will consider my claim?,Academic_Administration,"The Office of Extenuating Circumstances Claims will liaise with School(s) responsible for the programme to which the claim relates. The claim submitted is reviewed individually and confidentially. The Office decides whether to uphold your claim or not and will inform you via the online system, of its decision."
If I submit a claim for extenuating circumstances when do I have to hand in my work?,Academic_Administration,"Where a claim for extenuating circumstances on assessment has been submitted, you must continue to complete the assessment work (e.g. incourse with a predetermined deadline, Investigation Report, Final Year Project report) and submit it as soon as it is completed while waiting for the decision of the extenuating circumstances claim. The Office of Extenuating Circumstances Claims will take account of the timing of your extenuating circumstances and the original submission date.

What happens when IT equipment fails?,Academic_Administration,"Here are various scenarios related to IT equipment failure that are frequently encountered along with appropriate guidance: Failure of Personal Computer or Laptop: If you experience issues with your personal laptop or desktop equipment during an assessment submission, you must provide evidence of having the equipment repaired or enhanced at a service/repair outlet during the assessment period. Failing to provide evidence will result in the rejection of your claim. Failure of Network Connection: In the case of network connectivity issues affecting your work during assessment submissions (examinations or assignments), you must provide evidence of the network issue, including a timestamp and screen shots. This should be accompanied by any related communication with the lecturer or invigilation staff. Failure to provide this evidence will lead to claim rejection. Failure to Provide Appropriate Software: If you choose to work on an individual project with specific software requirements, it is your responsibility to ensure that this software is available before starting the project. Problems arising from software compatibility or availability will not be accepted as valid extenuating circumstances due to a lack of planning. Insufficient Computers in the Lab: If there are insufficient computers for the class size, the lecturer should take appropriate action, and this issue may be considered in the module assessment. Failure Affecting a Large Number of Systems at Assignment Deadline: If a significant number of computers are unavailable for an extended period, a short extension to the assignment deadline may be considered. You should have the Technical Assistant countersign your extenuating circumstances claim. Theft of Home Computer or Laptop: Students are expected to maintain backup copies of their work on a separate device. Claims based on theft without appropriate backup will not be upheld. Insufficient Computers/Printers: Claims based on the unavailability of computers or printers will not be supported, as they suggest inadequate planning. Incompatibility with APU/APIIT's Systems: Students should ensure that work from home can be presented or printed at APU/APIIT well in advance of assessment deadlines. Claims based on system incompatibility will not be upheld. Computer Failure Preventing Saving Work: Claims related to computer failure should be accompanied by the submission of the latest draft of your work. Early Closure of Computer Labs: Claims based on labs closing earlier than expected will not be supported, as they indicate a lack of advanced planning. Failure of Backup Device: Claims based on backup device failure are rarely upheld. Students are expected to have secure backup copies of their work. If a backup device fails, the latest draft of the work must be submitted by the regular hand-in date. Failure of Both Main Disk and Backup Device: If both main disk and backup device failures occur due to system issues, it may be considered, provided APU/APIIT Technical Services staff can confirm the incident. Students are expected to submit the latest draft of their work. In summary, it's essential to plan ahead and take necessary precautions to ensure the safety and accessibility of your work in case of IT equipment failure. Claims should be accompanied by appropriate evidence and meet the outlined criteria."

OpenID Connect With CAS User Guide,IT_Helpdesk,"Overview

OpenID Connect is a protocol for authenticating users, built on top of the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. Using CAS, you can act as an OpenID Connect Provider (OP), authenticating users using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol, or as a relying party (RP) that requests user authorization from an OP.
Terminology

Access token A credential that is used to access protected resources. An access token is a string, and represents an authorization that is issued to the client. Authorization Endpoint A resource on an OpenID Provider that accepts an authorization request from a client to perform authentication and authorization on a user. The authorization endpoint returns an authorization grant (or code) to the client in the Basic Client Profile. In the Implicit Client Profile, the authorization endpoint returns an ID token and access token to the client. The authorization grant is a credential that represents a user’s authorization to access resources. This credential is used by a client to obtain an access token. Claim Information that is asserted about an entity. Examples of a claim include a phone number, given name, or surname.ID token A JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains claims about the authenticated user.Introspection EndpointA resource on an OpenID Provider that enables a client that holds an access token to retrieve information. The information is used to create the access token (such as the user name, granted scopes, or client ID).OpenID Provider (OP) An OAuth 2.0 authorization server that can provide claims to a client, or Relying Party (RP). Refresh TokenA token that is issued to the client by the OP. The token is used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires or to obtain more access tokens. Relying Party (RP)Either a WebSphere Application Server configured as an OpenID Connect Client, or a client application that requires claims from an OpenID Provider (OP). Scope Privilege or permission that is allowed to access resources of a third party.Token EndpointA resource on an OpenID Provider that accepts an authorization grant (or code) from a client in exchange for an access token, ID token, and refresh token.

What is Central Authentication Service or CAS?,IT_Helpdesk,"The CAS (Central Authentication Service) login service allows you to access multiple computing systems after entering your username and password only once on a central authentication server. This is often referred to as single sign-on. For example, if you log in to PAWS, you will be able to access services such as Blackboard or wikis without having to log in again.

CAS currently supports several web applications. In the future, all other systems will use CAS as well.

You will be automatically redirected to the CAS login screen when you access one of the supported systems, unless you have already authenticated to CAS during your session. You can also reach the CAS login screen directly at https://cas.apiit.edu.my/cas/login.

CAS currently supports two types of authentication: REST, and Direct. CAS clients can be deployed on a combination of platforms including Windows, Linux, and both Apache and IIS. CAS supports a variety of tools and languages.

While CAS authentication will only return a username, you can use that username to query ADS and retrieve more information."
Information about integrating CAS with a website,IT_Helpdesk,"There are several different ways for applications to integrate CAS authentication, including login and validation.
When integrating CAS authentication with your application, follow these best practices:
Applications using CAS must operate entirely over TLS (i.e., the cas url must be an HTTPS URL).
Enabling HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is highly recommended.
To be sure they are authenticating to APIIT Education Group’s CAS, users must be able to see the URL https://cas.apiit.edu.my/cas/login.

Therefore, applications must redirect to CAS and not render the login page inside an iframe or use other similar techniques."
User accounts login problem in CAS,IT_Helpdesk,"There have been multiple cases where provided the credential to CAS was correct but authentication fails. The CAS was logging the issue on principle cannot be null. After checking the user account’s returned LDAP attributes and values the problem has been found.

The CAS is expecting “cn” to be equal to sAMAccountname, however, there are some students that their “cn” is equal to their name. That is an exception which cannot be handled by CAS. In case of similar issues please do check the cn.

The issue is where the account “CN” is not equal to the student ID."

Why does the similarity report say Pending after I resubmit?,IT_Helpdesk,"There are many reasons why you may want to resubmit to Turnitin. Perhaps you discover a mistake, or you were only checking your similarity report ahead of the deadline. This guide helps you to understand what you can and cannot do with resubmissions.

Turnitin allows you to resubmit 3 times, and then you must wait 24 hours. 

If you make a resubmission, you will see this message:

You have already submitted a paper to this assignment and a Similarity Report was generated for your submission. If you choose to resubmit your paper, your earlier submission will be replaced and a new report will be generated. After three resubmissions, you will need to wait 24 hours after a resubmission to see a new Similarity Report.

This policy is set by Turnitin. Moodle Support is not able to override this or make reports generate faster. 

Instructors are advised not to submit request to delete submissions to make multiple re-submissions with an assumption that this action will generate the Similarity Report quicker. Turnitin Support will not entertain deletion requests of this nature.

This does not mean that your submission will be considered late, even if the report is still pending after the due date. The time and date shown in the submitted column is considered your official submission time. Your tutors will understand that sometimes the report will take longer.

Please only contact us if the report has taken longer than 24 hours to appear.  Open a ticket with ITHelpdesk  via Virtual Help Centre or go to APSpace > More > Help Centre, and mention the name of the Course Code where you submitted it and link of Moodle Course Folder, and the Paper ID."

An Overview of Assignments in Moodle,IT_Helpdesk,"Assignments in Moodle allow you to collect and evaluate student work. Managing student work using an Assignment activity gives you the following benefits:
:paperclip: Paperless management of student work 

The Assignment activity provides a convenient database of student submissions that you can organize and manage online.
:thought_balloon: Grading and feedback through Moodle

The Assignment activity includes a grading interface through which you can enter grades and provide feedback to each student.
:calendar_spiral: Due dates automatically appear in the Calendar

 If you specify a due date for an assignment, that date will appear in the Calendar block and in the Upcoming Events block. Students can see at a glance when their work will be due.

 
:gear: Assignment activity can manage the following kinds of submissions:
Online text

Students enter content directly into a text box on the assignment submission page. Useful for short papers or brief paragraphs.

 
File submissions

 Students upload files on the submission page. Useful for longer papers or other file-based work.

 
Both Online text and files

Students can upload files and type text online. For example, a student can upload a file containing an essay and use the online text box to write a brief cover note to the instructor.
Offline work: - No Online Submission
You can also create an assignment activity with no online submission options for students. This is useful for evaluating work such as papers you are collecting in print, classroom presentations, performances, or lab experiments. The activity can be graded in Moodle and the due date will appear in the Calendar block."
Assessment Overview,IT_Helpdesk,"Assessment and feedback are at the heart of the student experience, shaping students’ understanding of the curriculum, and influencing student progress on the programme and career choices. The assessment also forms a significant part of the workload for academics and administrators and yet is an area that is often rated unsatisfactory by students. (JISC, 2010)

When setting assessment deadlines online, we recommend that deadlines are set between 9-5 Monday-Friday to ensure educational technology, technology, and course office support is available for students who experience problems with their online assessment. Review the Module Page Checklist: Assessment Information on Module Page for requirements around online assessment.
:thought_balloon: E-Assessment benefits

Using technology can bring many benefits to the assessment process and some of these are outlined below:

    Greater variety and authenticity in the design of assessments

    Improved learner engagement, for example through interactive formative assessments with adaptive feedback

    Choice in the timing and location of assessments

    Capture of wider skills and attributes not easily assessed by other means, for example through simulations, e-portfolios and interactive games

    Efficient submission, marking, moderation and data storage processes

    Consistent, accurate results with opportunities to combine human and computer marking

    Immediate feedback

    Increased opportunities for learners to act on  feedback, for example by reflection in e-portfolios

    Innovative approaches based around the use of creative media and online peer and self-assessment

    Accurate, timely and accessible evidence on the effectiveness of curriculum design and delivery

Options for Assessment in Moodle,IT_Helpdesk,"Moodle offers many different styles of assessment, from quizzes to peer assessment to video assignments. Quiz: The Quiz activity allows you to design and build quizzes consisting of a large variety of question types, including multiple-choice, true-false, and short answer questions. Questions are kept in the Question Bank and can be re-used in quizzes in different modules. Moodle Quiz can help to build students’ confidence by providing opportunities for them to consolidate their learning, and offering instant personalized feedback. Lecturers can also benefit from using quizzes to identify parts of the curriculum that students are struggling with and to gather feedback about the content covered in lectures. Moodle Quiz activity supports diagnostic and formative assessment as well as summative exams.

Assignment Guide: There are three separate assignment activities in Moodle – Turnitin, Moodle, and Video assignment. Assignment activities in Moodle enable students to submit their coursework as a file upload or online text and allows the Lecturer to assess, grade and provide feedback. Our Assignment Guide outlines the functionality of each activity to help you to select a tool that meets your requirements.

Peer Assessment Guide: Peer assessment is the assessment of students’ work by their peers against set assessment criteria. By assessing or evaluating each other’s work, students take up the role of appraisers and, over time, acquire the skills they need to make judgments on their own work. In general, there are two types of peer assessments:

    Assessment of team contribution in group work – members of a group assess the performance of their peers in terms of their contribution to the group’s work.
    Assessment of coursework undertaken by other students – students provide feedback/grades on their peers’ work.
    In either case, self-assessment may be included as part of peer assessment. Self-assessment requires students to reflect on their own work and judge how well they have performed in relation to the assessment criteria. Developing reflective skills provides students with the ability to consider their own performance and to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and areas that require improvement. Students can then use this knowledge to influence their future work, whether on a program of study or in employment. Moodle has two peer assessment activities and also the Database and Forum activity which can be used to support Peer Assessment. Our Peer Assessment Guide outlines the functionality of each activity to help you select a tool that meets your requirements.

Forum: The Forum activity allows students and lecturers to exchange ideas by posting comments as part of a ‘thread’. The Forum can be used for formative and summative assessments that require students to communicate, collaborate, debate or critique.

Wiki: A wiki is a collaboratively designed webpage or series of webpages. Each time a person makes changes to a wiki page, their revision of the content becomes the current version, and an older version is stored. Edits can be reverted if necessary. Wikis can be used for formative and summative assessments that require students to collaborate and co-create content."
Assignment Feedback Files & Feedback comments,IT_Helpdesk,"you may return annotated files to students through a Moodle Assignment, if you want to make comments on files (for example, using Track Changes in a Word document or adding comments to a PDF). 

Additionally, Moodle can automatically match feedback files to the proper student if all contributions are downloaded to a .zip file, the original file names supplied by Moodle are retained, the files are compressed into a new .zip file, and the .zip file is uploaded to a Moodle Assignment. This is especially handy if you want to annotate several files but don't want to publish them all separately to give students comments."

Creating a Course Backup and Restoring File,IT_Helpdesk,"Course backup files provide a way to move all of the contents of a Moodle course to a new location. The file is similar to a .zip archive file and is a way to save the information from an entire course - including student data - in one compressed package. You might want to take a backup file to another school's Moodle server, move it to a new course site on the same server, or simply keep it on your own hard drive or in your own Google Drive space for future use.  Unpacking a backup in a new location on Moodle is called doing a RESTORE. 

There is also a way to IMPORT files from one-course site on Moodle to another, which moves files and activities but does not include most student data. To learn more about the difference between RESTORE and IMPORT, see Restoring a Course Backup to an Empty Course Site. If you'd prefer to use the import function, see Adding Material from Past Courses, earlier in this guide. If you're uncertain which to use, please contact Digital Pedagogy.

Facilitating multiple markers,IT_Helpdesk,"You can facilitate multiple markers by either using Group mode under Common module settings for Turnitin and Moodle assignments or Marking workflow for Moodle assignments.

We recommend using the Groups method, as the Marking workflow method is more complex to setup and requires additional steps to release the final grades and feedback to students.
Groups

Students must first be added to groups.

Step 1 - Open the assignment you want to edit, click on the :gear: icon and click on  edit settings

Step 2 - Set Group mode (under Common module settings) to Separate groups. You may also first try directly proceeding to step 5 as this setting should be the default already

Step 3 - Scroll down to Restrict access

Step 4 - Click on Add restriction and select Group

 

 

 

Step 5 - Select the group you wish to give exclusive access to

Step 6 - Click Save and return to course or Save and display.

 
Marking workflow

If you enable Marking workflow then marks will go through a series of workflow stages before being released to students. You can then use the Marking allocation feature to allocate markers to particular students.

Step 1 - When setting up your assignment, scroll down to Grade.

Step 2 - Set Use Marking workflow, and Use marking allocation to Yes.

Step 3 - Click Save and return to course or Save and display.

Step 4 - When setting up your assignment under the Grade settings, set Use Marking workflow, and Use marking allocation to Yes.

Step 5 - Click Save and return to the course or Save and display

Step 6 - Open the assignment you wish to adjust and select View all submissions.

Step 7 - Check the boxes alongside the students who you want to allocate to a specific marker. Scroll down to With selected… and select Set allocated marker and then click Go.

Then click OK.

The marker’s name then appears in the Marker report area."
Full-Time and Part-Time Masters Under the Same Folder,IT_Helpdesk,"As of now, since the script automating the creation of Moodle class folder does not separate part-time from full-time, the current solution would be to restrict student access by Sections, very much the same way the restrictions are applied to the Verifications and Results Sections

These restrictions allow you to include material into a Section without having to hide individual activities based on groups

Step 1- Click Turn Editing On to start editing

Step 2 - Go to the very bottom of the page and click Add Topics.

Step 3 - Add the number of Sections as per your requirement.

Step 4 - Edit and name the Section under General settings.

Step 5 - Click Restrict access and select Add restriction.

Step 6 - Select method of restriction (in this case, advisable to use Group).

Step 7 - Set your conditions.

    Leave the first condition as ‘Must’

    Pick which group will have access to this Section

To add multiple groups under one folder, click on Add Restriction. This will change the layout slightly.

With multiple groups, set the second condition to ‘Any’. This means that if the student belongs to any of the mentioned groups, they will have access to it, and you do not need to hide individual groups.

 

Once you save, it will look something like this. It will only be visible to students belonging to those groups.  Whatever documents or activities you put in here will only be seen by those groups.

 

Since part-time and full-time have different requirements, these two Sections can be separated as well for ease of record-keeping. You CANNOT duplicate Sections, but you can duplicate topics and activities.

Step 8 - Duplicating Verifications and Results.

Go to the topic which you wish to duplicate and click on Edit. There will be a :file_cabinet: Duplicate option.

 

A duplicate with the same topic name will appear but with a ‘(copy)’ at the back.

Turn editing off and go on with the rest of your set up."

Group Assignment Quickstart Guide,IT_Helpdesk,"Please ensure that all the students on your module are in a group before submissions are made. If you do not do this then one student’s assignment submission will become available to all students. All groups must be correct prior to the first submission. Changing group membership after one submission will result in assignments being deleted.

Please refer to our guidance on Adding Groups to your module for more information.

When using group assignments you need to set up and apply groupings in addition to groups. This is because group submissions can disappear if groups are used and a student is in one group and is subsequently added to another group. This setting is to be applied under step 7 of this guide.

What does the setting require all group members to submit mean?

    If set to No:

    All members of the group have the ability to submit a file on behalf of the group.

    All group members can replace the submitted file with a new one at any point up to the assignment deadline.

    Once the submission deadline is passed the submitted file is automatically assumed to have been agreed as the final one by each of the group members.

    If set to Yes:

    All members of the group have the ability to submit a file on behalf of the group.

    Each group member must click the Submit assignment button to confirm that this is the final version of the assignment as agreed with the group.

    Once a group member has clicked Submit assignment, they cannot change their mind and replace the submitted file with any other file even if the assignment deadline has not yet been reached.

    Group members who have not clicked Submit assignment can replace the submitted file with a new file. If the last member of the group to submit, changes the file submission and clicks Submit assignment, other members of the group will not be able to change it. The group will need to contact the lecturer or course officer to revert the assignment to Draft (see additional note below).

    The assignment is not deemed to be submitted until each of the group members has clicked the Submit assignment button.

    When one student has submitted, the other members of the group will be able to see who still has to submit.

 Click for more information on reverting an assignment to Draft status when ‘Require all group members submit’ is set to Yes

If the assignment is reverted to draft after it has been submitted, the submission status for each student in the group will revert to Draft but it is only the student whose record the lecturer clicked on in the grading action screen to revert the submission who needs to re-submit. The other students will have a Draft status but they will not be included in the list of students who need to submit. If the lecturer then reverts more students in the group, the status for all students in the group will still be Draft but only students whose submission status was clicked to revert the submission will need to re-submit, and not the others in the group. When all those students who need to re-submit have re-submitted, the status of the assignment in the gradebook will be displayed as Submitted for all members of the group.

Step 1- Create: Turn editing on. Open the section you would like to add an assignment in and choose Add an activity or resource.Select Assignment from the Activity list and and it will be added(and opened).

Step 2- General: In the General settings, provide a name and a description for your assignment.Check the box if you would like to Show the Description on the module page.If needed, upload the files you would like to attach to this assignment (i.e. assignment cover sheet).

Step 3- Availability:  In the Availability box, select the date the assignment will be available from and the deadline for submissions (Due date). 

We recommend that assignment deadlines are set between 9-5 Monday-Friday to ensure educational technology and course office support is available for students who experience problems submitting assignments.The Cut-off date is the date after the deadline that students can submit until. This is useful for managing late submissions. Please note that students who submit until the deadline can edit their assignment if the cut-off date has not yet been reached.The Remind me to grade by date appears in Module Events & Upcoming Events blocks for staff enrolled on a module to remind them of grading deadlines.

Step 4- Submission types & accepted file types: In the Submission types box, decide whether the submission will be online text or students will upload a file. Typically our assignments are File submissions so no change needs to be made.For a file submission assignment then indicate how many files students can submit from the Maximum number of uploaded files.Accepted file types can be restricted by selecting from a drop-down list. If the field is left empty, then all file types are accepted.

Step 5- Feedback types: In most cases, you will not need to change the settings in the Feedback types box.If you need to review these settings, please refer to the Feedback types of guidance.

Step 6- Submission settings: In the Submission settings box, select Yes in the Require students to click submit button only if you want all members of a group to click the Submit assignment button to confirm that this is the final version of the assignment as agreed with the group.

The setting Require that students accept the submission statement will be enabled by default on assignments. Please do not change this setting as it is important that students understand what is required of them in regards to Academic Integrity Statement prior to submitting an assignment.

Step 7- Group assignment settings: The Students submit in groups option should be to Yes, to create a group assignment.

    Require group to make a submissionSet this to Yes. When a student who is not in a group attempts to submit, Moodle will display a message “You’re not a member of any group; please contact your lecturer”, and the student will not be able to submit the assignment.

    Require all group members submitThis setting will only be enabled if you have ticked the “Require students click submit button” earlier.

If Yes is selected, then the assignment will not be classed as “submitted” until all members of the group have submitted.

    Grouping for student groups

This setting allows you to select a grouping for your assignment. If students are in more than one group on the module, or may be added to another group later, you will need to select the relevant grouping to manage the group assignment. For example, James Jones is in Project Group A and Lisa’s Personal Tutor Group on your module. If you don’t create an assignment grouping, James will have the option of submitting an assignment to two separate groups, Project Group A and Lisa’s Personal Tutor Group

If a particular grouping is selected here, then the gradebook will display any other groups and non-grouped students in the “default group”.

    If “none” is selected, then the gradebook will display the names of all the groups and put any non-grouped students into the “default group”.

 

Please refer to our guidance on Groups and Groupings for more information.

Step 8- Notifications : In most cases, you will not need to change the Notifications settings

Please refer to the Assignment – Individual guidance if you require a specific setting for this.

Step 9- Grade: In the Grade section, select the type of grade and the grading method. The most common settings are point and simple direct grading.

    If you need to use the more advance settings:

    Please refer to the guidance on how to use scales as grades, and Marking Record and Grades as grading methods.

    Please refer to the guidance on Facilitating multiple markers and anonymous marking if you need to set a process with several markers or blind marking.

    Due to the way that groups are managed in Moodle, it is not possible to have an anonymous group assignment as the group name displays in the assignment submission area. This means that lecturers who may have set up the groups can differentiate between the submissions or can go to the groups in Moodle to see the group members via Settings >Users > Groups.

Step 10- Common settings: In the Common module settings, you can decide if you want to show or hide your assignment using the Availability settings. You do not need to change the group mode, this is managed from Group assignment settings in step 7."
Groups in Moodle,IT_Helpdesk,"You can assign different group modes to activities within Moodle which will shape how that activity behaves. For groups to work correctly all students must be assigned to a group.

    Example: Applying a group mode under Common module settings within Assignments enables different markers to filter the submissions between groups. This means that the lecturer can view and mark the submissions in the group they are responsible for marking.

    Collaborative Activities: Within collaborative activities such as Forums or Wikis, the group mode under Common module settings can be used to engage students in group work (i.e each group has their own collaborative workspace).

    Assignment Tool: The assignment tool offers an option from Group assignment settings for students to submit one piece of work on behalf of their group and for you to assign the same mark and feedback to the entire group.

    Restricting Access: Groups can be used to define which group can access an activity or resource. If you want to restrict an activity or resource to ensure that only students in a group can access it, select Group under Restrict access when setting up the activity."
Groupings,IT_Helpdesk,"    Groupings are collections of groups. If a student is in more than one group, or you want a subset of groups to work on an activity, you will need to use Groupings for the Groups to work correctly on the activity.
        Example: If you had not set up Groupings in this scenario, Moodle would have no way of knowing which groups needed to be attached to the Forum. Joe Bloggs would have had access to two Forums one for Tutor Group 1 and one for Project Group B!

How do I allow a single student to continue their existing quiz (exam) attempt?,IT_Helpdesk,"Moodle allows for individual user overrides and group overrides for quizzes. These overrides can be used to allow a different number of quiz attempts, as well as a different open/close date/time windows and a different time limit.

However, if you want the student’s second attempt to be a continuation of the first, you will need to change some overall Quiz Settings before you can accurately enter the override.  This could be necessary, for instance, to provide the student 15 more minutes to finish the midterm, because the student had lost internet connection at the very end of the 100-question test.

So the goal is only to basically to re-open the attempts so the student can finish. However, there isn’t re-open an quiz attempt in Moodle. BUT you can have the system build on that first attempt for a single student…and it’s basically the same.

To add a second attempt building on the previous for a single user or a group of users by utilizing an override, follow these steps."
How to add a second attempt for a single user/group of users by utilizing an override?,IT_Helpdesk,"Step 1 - Click on the activity you wish to apply changes to.

 

Step 2 -  Click the gear icon(top right of the page) and select Edit Settings.

Step 3 - Scroll down to the Grade section and change Attempts allowed from 1 to 2

Step 3 - Under override user, select the student(s) you want to allow.

 

Step 4 - Edit the remaining settings.

 

    Require password – Require the individual with the override to enter a password to complete the quiz.

    Open the quiz & Close the quiz – Adjust the open and close date/time windows. Don’t forget to check to “Enable” button so that you can adjust these settings.

    Time limit – Change the time limit. Don’t forget to check to “Enable” button so that you can adjust this setting.

    Attempts allowed – Allow more (or less) attempts than the quiz defaults.Scroll down and adjust the necessary settings.

 

Step 5 - Click on Save.

 

    For a second attempt, you would change the “Attempts allowed” to “2.” If you are only allowing a short amount of time to complete the already begun exam, then you would also need to adjust the “Time limit” to the a shorter amount required to complete the exam.

    Don’t forget to double-check that the “Close the quiz” date/time has not already passed or you will need to adjust this setting as well. 

    If you do not alter one or more of these settings, the settings will remain at the original quiz defaults. For example, if the quiz is closed to all students because the quiz’s original close date/time has passed and you do not adjust the override’s close date/time, even if you give a specific student a second attempt, they will not be able to access the quiz."
How do I restrict access to items or activities to certain groups or students of the course?,IT_Helpdesk,"There are some modules that has two intakes starting in the same month ex.(062020) which will be in one course in Moodle. Therefor, you can differentiate between them by choosing the targeted groups from the filter in participants page as below:

 

There are many cases in which it is useful to restrict access to material or activities in Moodle.  

For example -  sharing information with graders or keeping extra material hidden which can be done by following the below steps:

Step 1 - Click on Turn editing on from top right gear 



Step 2 - Create or edit the resource or activity you want to limit access to.

 

Step 3 - Under Restrict Access, click Add restriction and Select “Group” and pick the group you want to have access to the item i.e Group A.

You can also combine a number of restrictions if you continue to click Add restriction.

Click on the eyeball next to your group so that the item will be hidden totally from users not in that group.

Step 4 - Save changes.  When you return to the course main page you will see an indication that the item is restricted.

 

 
Restricting Topics

It is possible to add a group restriction on a topic or week.  Follow the same procedure as above, but set the restriction on the entire topic.  You will need to leave the topic and all its contents visible, but Moodle will display a label indicating that access to the topic is restricted.  You do not need to adjust the permissions/restrictions for any of the items within the topic.  If the topic itself is restricted so will all the contents of the topic.
Different Intakes

One module folder may contain two or more intakes, which can then be found confusing when adding content and activities. Please note the enrollment process is automated by the system. In order to not confuse the materials and activities intended for different groups a solution is to utilise restrictions (see step 4 of article) so that the students from different intakes will be able to see materials meant for them while being in the same folder.

Important Tip -  If you restrict access to an entire section, all activities in that section will follow the restrictions set. That way, you do not have to set restrictions one by one for each activity."

How to Create a Course in Moodle?,IT_Helpdesk,"A guide in Moodle is a complete training session with theory and practice. The theory helps to convey knowledge with the help of lessons containing text, images, and videos; hands-on activities such as quizzes (check out our How to Create a Moodle Quiz: Step-by-Step Guide) allow you to check how much the student has learned.
Creating a Lesson in Moodle

As an example, we’ll build a course on Workplace Safety rules and a lesson on Fire Safety. To continue, you’ll need to open a class-specific folder and get the source file with text so you can just copy and paste it in the sample lesson.

Step 1 - Open your Course in Moodle

From the course overview, open your class-specific folder.

 

 
How to Add a Topic to the Course?

Step 2 - When you open a class-specific folder on Moodle, on the top right corner of the page click on setting gear icon. A drop-down menu list will open and from this list select “Turn editing on”.

 

Step 3 - Scroll down and you will see an option to Add an activity or resource and Add topics. Click on Add topics it and a window will popup to enter a number of topics you want to add. For this example, we will add only 1 (one) topic and click Add topics.

 

Step 4 - A new topic will be created Topic 1, rename this to Fire Safety and then, in this section of topic click Add an activity or resources. From Add an activity or resources popup window, under the list of Activities look for Lesson, select this activity and click Add.

You will be redirected to a page for the configuration of this Lesson. We’ll need to set up four sections:

    General: Enter the name of the lesson and its description.

    Appearance: Configure the lesson design. Would you like learners to see a progress bar or demonstrate the lesson as a slideshow?

    Flow Control: Set up the rules for taking the lesson. For example, it’d be wise to allow learners to view the lesson on fire safety several times, but for an exam session, it’s better to give just one attempt.

    Grade: Determine the rules of assessment. Will you use points or a scale to evaluate the results? What is the passing grade? For the sample lesson, set four points as the passing grade as there are four test tasks.

Step 5 - Click Save and display.

 
How to Create a Question Page?

Step 6 - Our sample lesson starts with the question, What do you do if you smell smoke? To add it, click Add a question page in the Edit tab.

Step 7 - From the list of select a question type; select Multichoice for the sample and then, click Add a question page.

    Next, you will be redirected to the question page setup. Starting with question page title and content.

Page title
	

What to do if a fire starts

Page contents
	

Imagine it’s an ordinary day at the office. Suddenly, you smell smoke.

 

What do you do?

Step 8 - Now you have to provide an answer and responses for multiple choice. Define the award for the correct answer. You may just leave 1 point by default.

Answer 1
	

I’ll look around to find the nearest stairway, leave all my belongings, and run to the exit.

Response
	

Right. You didn’t panic and got out. Yet you managed to breathe in smoke, as you didn’t protect your nose and mouth while evacuating.

    Make sure there are no points given, as this answer is wrong.

Answer 2
	

I’ll pack up and go to the nearest exit.

Response
	

Wrong. When there’s smoke in the building, you must leave immediately. By wasting time on packing things, you may lose your chance to get out, as smoke and fire spread very quickly.

Step 9 - Click Save page.

    Your question page will be successfully added to the course.

 
How to Create a Content Page?

Step 10 - The content page is a building block for creating a lesson in Moodle. It may contain text, pictures, audio or video. You can click Add a content page in the beginning.

Step 11 - But in our case of this sample course, we first created question page after, we can create more pages by clicking on Add new page and from drop-down list select Add a content page.

    Below, you will also see a Content 1 (Content 2, Content 3, and so on) section. Using these fields, you can set up navigation within a lesson. Each Content is a button that forwards a learner to another page of the lesson. For instance, you can create buttons for every page of the lesson using the Jump option, so learners will be able to jump to a different page – next page, previous page, first page, last page, or any other page on the course. If you prefer closed navigation and don’t fill in the Content fields, then learners will have to study the pages one by one.

    For the sample course, we don’t need any extra navigation buttons except Next and Previous.

Step 12 - Create the Next button by entering the word, Next in the Content 1 description and choose to jump to the Next page on each new page you add, and Previous in the Content 2 description and choose to jump to Previous page on each new page you add.

 
How to Add More Content and Question Pages?

Step 13 - Create the rest of the pages using the lesson source file. By clicking on Add new page and from drop-down list select the type of page you want to add – content page, question page. etc. In the end, you should get the following structure:

How to Create a Moodle Quiz: Step-by-Step Guide,IT_Helpdesk,"In this tutorial, we will show you how to create a quiz in Moodle and how to set it up so users do not cheat and the results are credible. We will also create a small linear sample quiz together to put theory into practice right away. You can download the sample quiz here [https://dif7uuh3zqcps.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2020/03/01190408/Sample-Questions-for-Moodle-Quiz.docx]

Now, let’s get started.

Step 1 - Open your Course in Moodle

Step 2 - From the course overview, open your class specific folder.

Step 3 - Click “Turn editing on”

When you open class specific folder on Moodle, on the top right corner of the page click on setting gear icon. A drop down menu list will open and from this list select Turn editing on.

 

Step 4 - Click on “Add activity or resources

Step 5 - Scroll down and you will see the option to Add an activity or resource. Click on it and a window will pop up with list of activity and resources.

Step 6 -  Add quiz: From Add an activity or resources popup window, under the list of Activities look for Quiz, select this activity and click Add. You will be redirected to a page for the configuration of this new Quiz.

Step 7 - Set up Quiz: Enter the quiz name and its description. It’s also important to set a number of options so that students do not cheat. You can find details on each option in this Moodle help doc; in this article, we’ll cover the basic settings.

For this tutorial, we will name the quiz “Tutorial 1-Quiz” and description shown in the screenshot below.

 

    Setting #1: Timing. Protect From Cheating

By default, students have unlimited time to pass the quiz; they can get started today and finish in three days with the highest score by copying the answers from the textbook. To obtain credible results, we will set an assessment period and time limit.

You can set the start date and time of the quiz by checking Enable in Open the quiz option. The quiz will automatically open on the set date and time, for example in the screenshot below the test will open on 2 April 2020 at 10 am, until that students will only see the description of the quiz.

Likewise, you can set the end date and time of the quiz by checking Enable in Close the quiz option. The quiz will automatically close at the set time and date, for example in the screenshot below the test will close on 3 April 2020 at 10 am. If a student forgets to take the quiz in time then, he or she will automatically fail the quiz.

Next, we will set the quiz Time limit. Usually, 30 minutes to an hour is enough, but it depends on the complexity of the assessment. In some cases, students may need 3 or 4 hours. When students start answering questions, they see a countdown timer that shows how much time is left, and when the time expires, the quiz is automatically closed. For example, we will set a time limit for 30 minutes for this sample quiz.

The rest of the options in this section can be left as they are by default.

 

    Setting #2: Grade. Set a Passing Grade

With the default settings, your students have an unlimited number of attempts to answer the same question. As a result, a quiz can be passed by a random choice method: they make a mistake and immediately change the answer, and so on until they pass. If you prefer students not to play guessing games, limit the number of attempts, and set a passing score.

Grade to pass – Set a minimal passing grade. This is the minimum score required to pass a quiz. The pass grades are highlighted in green, and fail grades in red. As there are only two questions in this sample quiz, let’s set one (1) point as the passing grade.

Attempts allowed – Limit the number of attempts to avoid guessing games. If this is a final exam, you can give just one attempt, and perhaps three for a pop quiz.

 

    Setting #3: Layout. Build a Structure

You can group questions into blocks and place each question on a new page, or all the questions on one page. If all the questions are on one page, students can see the whole quiz at a glance.

 

    Setting #4: Question Behavior. Shuffle Answers

For additional anti-cheat protection, choose Yes in the Shuffle within questions so that the parts making up each question will be randomly shuffled each time users take the quiz.

    Setting #5: Overall Feedback. Provide a Final Comment

The overall feedback is a message which users see after completing the quiz. You can show different text depending on the final score: praise high performers and tell failed students the rules of retaking the quiz.

 

Step 8 - Set Maximum Score: Scroll down and click on Save and Display.

 

You will be redirected to a new page that shows the quiz you have just set up. Previously, we set the minimum passing grade for the quiz. Now, we need to indicate the highest score. Click Edit quiz.

Enter the maximum grade. Since there are only two questions in this sample quiz, the highest score will be two (2) points. Specify the maximum score. In this case, it’s 2 points

Step 9 - Add Quiz Questions: In Moodle, there are 15 types of questions you can add. We will create two of the most popular question types, True/False and Multiple Choice, so you can master the principles of making quizzes in Moodle and easily create other types of tasks on your own. Click on Add > a new question and Choose a question type to add window will popup.

 

    True/False Question

From Choose a question type to add popup window, under the list of Questions look for True/False, select this question type and click Add. You will be redirected to a page to set up True/False questions.

In the Adding a True/False question page, fill in a question name and question text (download sample quiz). You can also add images, video, audio, or a link to additional material on the topic of the question.

 

Step 10 - set the Correct answer. In our sample, the statement is true, so choose True in the drop down list. You can also add feedback for the response so that a learner can better understand the topic and improve it next time.

 

Step 11 - Click Save changes to publish the question; it will look like this:

 

    Multiple Choice Question

From Choose a question type to add popup window, under the list of Questions look for Multiple Choice, select this question type and click Add. You will be redirected to a page to set up True/False questions.

 

In the Adding a Multiple choice question page, fill in a question name and question text (download sample quiz). You can also add images, video, audio, or a link to additional material on the topic of the question.

 

In multiple choice questions, there can be more than one correct answers, but there is only one correct response in our sample question. Let’s choose this option – One answer only,  in the question settings. You can also set to shuffle choice for better control on cheating answers.

 

Now, add all the choices for the queston and you need to select the correct answer and give it a 100% grade. The rest of the responses are false, so we do not give points for choosing them and select None.

 

The rest of the options can be left at default. Click on Save changes. The published task looks like this:

 

You can also apply some additional display options such as:

    Whether correct: show or don’t show students if the response was correct

    Marks: show or don’t show students how much they score

    General feedback: show students a certain message upon completing the quiz

To find these options, click Preview question (a magnifying glass with a plus sign next to each question), scroll down and set them up in a pop-up window.

 

The quiz is now ready. All you need to do now is to assign it to students and keep track of their results from the Grades tab.
Open a Question Bank: 

So far, we have been discussing creating a quiz from scratch. If you are going to conduct regular assessments, it is convenient to use a question bank.

A question bank in Moodle is an overall stock of all the questions and tasks you have ever created on the platform. This feature saves time since there’s no need to create everything from scratch: if you need to prepare a test for a new course, you can simply copy ready-made tasks from the bank.

The two questions we created as a sample are already in the bank; to find them.

Step 1 - go to the course page and on the top right corner of the page click on setting gear icon. A drop down menu list will open and from this list select More.

 

Step 2 - Click Question bank in the new window. On this page, you can create new questions and find the ones you’ve already used. Next time you can try creating questions right on this page and build a new quiz with them.

Moodle gradebook,IT_Helpdesk,"
What is it?

The Moodle course Gradebook (or Grader report as it is also known) allows tutors and course administrators to manage grades for Moodle activities, such as assignments and quizzes, in that course. The Gradebook collects items that have been graded from the various assessed activities in Moodle and allows you to view and change them, as well as sort grade items into categories and calculate totals in various ways. When you add an assessed activity in a Moodle course, the Gradebook automatically creates space for the grades it will produce and then adds the grades as they are generated, either by the system (e.g. quizzes) or by you (e.g. assignments). Many activities in Moodle can be graded, including glossary and database entries (using ratings), lessons, quizzes, assignments, questionnaires, SCORM/AICC packages and scheduler meetings. 
Why use it?

To manage and view all student grades for a particular module.

To define the way grades are displayed to students - e.g. letter grades, percentages, scale grades etc.
Who can use it?

Tutors or course administrators can use the Gradebook to view and manage grades. 

Students can use the Gradebook to view their own grades only.

 
:thought_balloon: Before I start...

When viewing the Gradebook there are three different types of reports you can view:
1. Grader Report

The Grader report is shown by default and shows each student down the left side and each category, gradable activity and grade for the current Moodle course along the top of the page. The list of students can be sorted using the arrows alongside each activity name. Clicking the name of the activity will take you to the student's attempts for that activity, assuming there are some. The course total displays to the far right, so you may need to scroll down and to the right to see this.
2. User Report

The User report is what students see by default and shows the grade, percentage and feedback for each activity in the course. To view a student's grades, choose their name from the Select all or one user drop down menu on the right. You can filter by user to see the grades for any of your students. To view all the students' grades on one page (one after the other) select All users from the menu.
3. Overview Report

    The Overview report is only available for students and lists all the Moodle courses they are enrolled on, with their total grade for each. If they click on the Course name, they will see all the grade items and grades for that course (this will take them to the User report). To see this report for yourself click on the Settings menu (to the left of the page) and expand Switch role to.... then click Student. You will need to select a user from the drop-down menu on the right of the page (don't worry, students only see their own grades). Once you have finished seeing (roughly) what students see, click return to my normal role in the top, right corner of the page.

    Students can see their own grades for each activity providing it is not hidden. Grades can be hidden in the Gradebook and within the settings for that activity (e.g. Quizzes allow you to hide Scores from students). If you don't want your students to see grades ensure they are hidden in both the activity and the grade book.

:thought_balloon: How do I...?
1. Access the Gradebook

To access the Gradebook in your Moodle course, go to the Settings block and under Course, administration click on Grades.
As a tutor or course administrator, you will see three types of reports below the tabs: Grader report, Outcomes report and User report.
2. Add an additional grade item

When importing a spreadsheet of data you can select for grades to be added to a new grade item.

Alternatively, in the Gradebook, under the Setup tab, you can click Add grade item to create a new column for you to upload or enter grades.
3. Change the way grades display to students.

To change the way grades are displayed to students:

Step 1 - Login to Moodle and navigate to your course.

Step 2 -  Go to the Course Administration > Gradebook setup, or from the Gradebook click the setup tab.

 

Step 3 -  Alongside the assessment, you want to check/change the display of the grade click the Course grades settings tab.

 

Step 4 -  Choose the relevant grade display type, a combination of options are available between

i- Letter - letters or words used to represent a range of grades.

ii- Percentage

iii- Real - actual grade they received in the assessment. For Turnitin, this will likely be a score out of 100.

 

Step 5 - Click save changes.

When students view the Moodle course Gradebook or the MyFeedback report, they will now see the grade appear in the selected format.

 
How to Export the Gradebook?

Step 1 - From the Gradebook page, click the Export tab.

 

Step 2 - Select the specific grade items you wish to export. Possible grade items include Turnitin assignments, Moodle assignments, and the course total. At the end of the list of grade items there is an option to select all/none.



What are the Export Format options?

    You can select to Include feedback in export, which will include any Moodle assignment Feedback comments. This does not include inline comments, only the general feedback comments a marker can leave on a Moodle Assignment submission.
    You can also untick Exclude suspended users if you want to include students who have been un-enrolled in a course.

Step 3 - Click download to generate a spreadsheet of the Gradebook.

 
Further help
Further guidance on Grader report (Gradebook) is available from Moodle Docs.

If you find any inaccurate or missing information you can even update this yourself (it's a communal wiki).

In case of further inquiry, please open a ticket with the Virtual Help Centre. Alternatively, you may choose to access APSpace > More > Help Centre for further guidance and support. This guideline is designed for you to help you in the process of opening a ticket.
Caution

You may need to hide all the grades in your course, to prevent students seeing them before ratification.

 You can do this by following these steps:

    The Categories and items tab allows you to organise your grade items and aggregate grades using various methods for all the items in that category. A top-level category with the name of the Moodle course is added by default to the Gradebook and cannot be deleted. More information about grade categories is available in the next section of this document.

    You can hide all grades  

Examples and case studies

    Conditional (if, and, or) operators can be used in grade calculations of the grade book. This can be used to specify a grade below which certain activities must not fall.

Thank you and we hope the integration eases the workload in marking and mark entries."
Moodle-OBE integration troubleshooting,IT_Helpdesk,"When facing issues with exporting marks from Moodle to OBE, please check the following cases and see if any of these may be applied to your case:

Case 1 -  If your activity has multiple subcomponents, ensure that advanced grading (marking guide / rubric) is used. You can use simple direct grading but it is NOT advisable to use that if your activity consists of multiple subcomponents. The integration will not work properly.

Case 2 -  Ensure that the marking guide / rubrics are configured properly and used. Below is what happens when you have advanced grading setup but do not use it:

No subcomponents will be available

This is the notice you will see in the grading setup

If you intend to use simple grading, then the grading method must be set as such. Otherwise, if you intend to use marking guide/rubrics, then you must prepare it for use.

Case 3 -  Do not override the marks as it will cause issues when exporting to OBE. If you override the marks, it will be highlighted as yellow in the gradebook. Doing so will cause issues when exporting marks to OBE:

Do not do this. If you want to rectify the marks of a student, please regrade them in the grader accordingly and save the marks again.

Case 4 - If you do not find a particular student’s name when exporting marks (or you saw students under this tab while exporting):

please check to ensure that the lecture class code is assigned to them in the Participants tab. It is exactly like assigning a group to a student for group assignment purposes. REMEMBER to click on the disk icon to save. Otherwise, it will not register.

Case 5 - If you have made any changes to the marks after you have finalised your results, you will need to request assessment team to unfinalise them so that the new results can be finalised.

Case 6 -  Do not touch the grade weightage in Moodle, the grades in Moodle will auto-scale when exported to OBE:

Do not touch the weightage, leave it as default. If you have made changes to it, just untick them.

Case 7 -  If you made any changes to your rubric / marking guide AFTER you have marked your students, remember to save those marks again (just click save if the marks are already there). Otherwise, if you export to OBE, the grades will not register and export properly.

Please take note of this error message in the grader

Case 8 -  If you noticed that the results in OBE were not exported correctly, check your rubric / marking guide for any error messages. You may come across something like this if you did not set your marks properly:

The message is self-explanatory. If this is what is interfering with marks exporting, either adjust your rubric / marking guide or the total marks in your activity. Be warned that if you made changes, you will need to save all the marks again.

Case 9 -  Please ensure that the components in your rubric / marking guide DO NOT share the same name, otherwise this will cause issues. Like the case above, if you make a changes to the rubric / marking guide (component names included), you will need to save all the marks again.

Case 10 -  ALWAYS check your Module Descriptor and ensure that there are no mistakes in there because it WILL affect marks. For example:

Check how many questions need to be fulfilled and if it is supposed to be all questions or just a particular number only. If you, for example, select 1 out of 4, OBE will always pick the highest score. If that is not supposed to be the case, please correct your Module Descriptor.

Case 11 -  If your exam marks do not reflect correctly in OBE, ensure that ALL questions are graded, even if they were not answered by students (applies only for exams where all questions need to be answered). Otherwise, there will be mark disparity in OBE.

Case 12 -  Ensure that your marking guide matches EXACTLY your module descriptor requirements. For example, if your module descriptor requires 4 out of 6 sub-components to be fulfilled, you MUST have 6 criteria in your marking guide even if you are not using all of them (applies to lecturers who use Assignment to conduct exams). Otherwise, you may face an issue where you could not export your marks to OBE.

Important: You may come across a situation where the max grade of your marking guide is more than the default 100 marks (for example 150) after you include all criteria. This can be resolved by changing the total marks here in your assignment settings:

    If students have already submitted, go to the ‘Rescale existing grades’ option and select Yes, then change the maximum grade to match the maximum grade of your marking guide.

    If students have not submit, just change the maximum grade. 

Case 13 -  Do not match the same subcomponents in your module descriptor to different marking criteria in Moodle if you have more than one of it. For example:

In OBE, this component has 2 subcomponents. If you match only one of the subcomponents to two different criteria in Moodle as such:

It will not work properly."

Override for exam attempts for individual user and group,IT_Helpdesk,"Overrides allow a particular group or student to continue an exam attempt without having to reopen the entire exam topic. This is useful for singling out any students or groups facing issues (such as not being able to properly submit answers) and allowing them only access to the exam for a second attempt.
Individual User Override

Step 1 - Go to Edit and look for ‘User Overrides’

This step allows exam unit to give affected student an extra attempt to complete the exam

Step 2 - Add user override

You may add multiple user overrides.

Step 3 - Input the fields

    Override user: The name of the affected student

    Require password: Require the student to enter password (normally not necessary)

    Open the quiz: When the quiz starts

    Close the quiz: When the quiz ends

    Time limit: Time given for student to complete attempt

    Attempts allowed: The number of attempts allowed to students

 Add one extra attempt. For example, if 1 attempt was given by default, then put 2 when doing the override to allow a second attempt in submission.

Step 4 - Go to Edit Settings and look for Question Behaviour

Take note of the last option. Set it to Yes temporarily, this will make it so that it does not change the order of questions when re-attempting so student will continue where they left off.

 If the student did not click Finish and Submit at the end of the quiz, all there is need to be done is just go to the end of the quiz and ensure the button is clicked.  

Step 5 - Once the student has submitted the attempt, revert the ‘Each attempt builds on the last’ back to No.
Group Override

Group override functions like user override, except for this case, it covers a whole group instead.

Step 1 - Go to Edit and look for ‘Group Overrides’

Step 2 - Add group overrides

Step 3 - Input the fields

Once done, any student belonging to the selected group will be able to obtain an extra attempt in the exam. The override works the same as the individual user.

Apply step 4 and beyond from the User Overrides section here and continue from there
 "
Restore Deleted Activities & Courses in Moodle with the Recycle Bin,IT_Helpdesk,"Step 1 - From your course or category, select the :gear:  icon and select Recycle bin.

Step 2 - Click on the Restore icon :arrow_up:  in its column.

Step 3 - Done, navigate back to your dashboard or restore other files.

    All courses now have a recycle bin that retains deleted activities for 7 days before permanently removing them.

    In addition to restoring activities, users with relevant category permissions may also use the recycle bin to restore deleted courses. The recycle bin is available by default in all courses and categories, but the link in the administration block is only visible once something has been deleted.

    Administrators can modify the settings in the Site administration menu and can adjust how long an item or course will remain available until permanently deleted, as well as make the recycle bin visible in the administration block even when empty. If preferred, the recycle bin can be disabled.

    This feature can be a life saver for administrators who have been too hasty to delete an activity or course that they actually do, indeed, still need."
"Restrict access for activity, resource or section",IT_Helpdesk,"You can use the Restrict access settings to control the availability of learning materials based on any one or more of these condition(s). You may also combine the use of these conditions to add a set of nested restrictions to apply complex logic.

    Students’ completion of a previous activity
    Date (you can set from and until dates)
    Students’ grades for a previous assessed activity in the module
    Group setting in the module
    User Profile field (e.g., First name, email).

You can restrict access to individual resources or activities, or to the entire sections.

How to apply Restrict Access to your resource, activity, or section?

When you create a resource or activity, or edit a section summary, you will find the Restrict access settings near the end of the settings page. Expand the settings by clicking on it.

Click on the Add restriction… button, a choice of conditions appears.

What conditions are available for restriction?

    Activity Completion
    Activity Completion is enabled by default on new modules. If you are working on a pre-2019/20 module you will need to enable Completion Tracking from Settings>>Edit settings. Once you have set up Activity completion on an activity or resource, Activity completion becomes an option available from the Add restriction menu.

    You can use the Activity completion settings to define what constitutes completion. Restrict access in combination with Activity completion means that you can require that students view certain resources or complete certain activities before moving on to others.

    Activity completion Example…

    Date
    Access can be restricted from or until a certain date and time.

    Grade
    You can specify a condition on any grade in the course: the full course grade, or the grade for any activity in the module. You can enter either a minimum value (at least percentage), a maximum value (less than percentage), both, or neither by clicking on the relevant checkbox.

    Grade Example…

    Groups
    If Groups and Groupings are set up in the module, it is possible to restrict the activity or resource to a certain group or grouping (which is a cluster of groups). If you choose the option ‘Any group’, the resource/activity will be available to a student who has been assigned to a group (any group). It should not be misinterpreted as students who are not associated with any group.

    Groups Example…

    User Profile
    Every user account in Moodle has profile fields like name, city, country, etc. You can select to restrict the availability of materials base on a student’s Moodle identity. Some useful profile fields are:
        First name
        Email address

    This data is drawn from our student record system – GIMS and is recorded in specific coding. Please liaise with your course office if you want to utilize these fields.

    User Profile Example…

    Restriction set
    This allows you to add a set of nested restrictions combining the use of the above conditions in order to achieve a more complex logic.

How to choose ALL or ANY conditions?

If you add more than one restriction, you can decide if all the conditions need to be met or only some of them.

    ALL
    ALL the conditions need to be met. These are AND conditions.

    ANY
    ANY of the conditions are required before the activity is made available. These are OR conditions.

    For example - referral student can be restricted by:
    User Profile -> email address -> start with -> Student id (small letter: tp088393)

What will students see if a resource, activity or section has Restrict Access applied?

No matter which condition setting you have chosen, you can choose to either grey out/hide the activity/resource completely. To set these options, you use the eye icon next to the condition:

    Shut-eye
    If the eye is SHUT then students who do not meet that part of the condition will not see the activity at all.

    Open-eye
    If the eye is OPEN the students who do not meet that part of the condition will see the activity but it will be greyed out and have information about why they can’t access it yet.

The shut-eye takes precedence. For example, you could have two conditions, one based on date (with eye shut) and one based on completing a previous activity (with eye open). The activity will not appear for students until the date; then it will be visible with information for students explaining that they need to complete an activity before they can access the materials. When students complete the activity they can access the resources.

Example student view with open-eye for restrictions: Student id has to be small letter (tp088393)
"
Setting up group assignments,IT_Helpdesk,"When setting up group assignments, you may sometimes want to use custom groups for this purpose. Lecturers can create custom groups for that purpose. You may refer to Moodle’s comprehensive documentation here on how to do it.

Once you have created your groups, there is one more step you need to do before you set up your group assignment: grouping. Grouping will force the assignment to use the groups you specify rather than it using something unintended. You may refer to Moodle’s comprehensive documentation here [https://docs.moodle.org/311/en/Groups] on how to do it.
Set up groups

Step 1 - First, go to the ‘:busts_in_silhouette: Participants’ tab. of the module you wish to create groups in.

Step 2- Click on the :gear:  icon and click on ‘:busts_in_silhouette: Groups’

Step 3 -Click on ‘Create Group’

Step 4 - Fill in the required fields and click “Save changes”

 
Create groupings

Step 1 - Once you have created your desired groups, in the Group page, look for the tab called ‘Groupings’ and click on it

Step 2 - Click on ‘Create Grouping’

Step 3 - Create your grouping by entering at least the group name and once finished , click Save Changes 

Step 4 - Once saved, click on the :bust_in_silhouette:  person icon on the far right

Step 5 -  You may now assign groups to the grouping by selecting the group and clicking on either Add or Remove. This will be important when setting up group assignments.

Step 6 - Once you have assigned your required groups to the grouping, you can now select this grouping when creating your group assignment. 

When you click on the dropdown box for ‘Grouping for student groups’, you will be able to select the custom grouping you created. Once the assignment is created, all groups that show up in the assignment will only be the groups you assigned to the grouping.

"
Set up a Moodle Marking Record,IT_Helpdesk,"A marking record is very similar to a rubric, but it’s simpler. 

For each marking criterion, a comment explains what is being sought, and provides a maximum mark that can be awarded. Students can view the marking criteria before they submit so that they know what their learning priorities are in relation to the assignment. 

When you come to marking you can view the criteria and add in your comments and grades for each criterion as well as use the ‘frequently added comments’ function. Marking using a marking record is more detailed and less subjective than awarding a single grade.

    Marking Record should match the assessment criteria available to students for a specific module assignment. 

    Assignment criteria explains what a student needs to demonstrate in order to complete an assessment successfully.

     Assessment criteria will differ according to the discipline, the type of assessment and the level of students.

Marking record do not have to be completed online, ensure all your markers are able to mark offline.

 
Create a marking record for an assignment

Step 1 - On your module page, click Turn editing on

Step 2 - Scroll down to the assignment you wish to edit, click the edit button and select Edit Settings

Step 3 - Scroll down the page to the Grade settings

Step 4 - Select Marking guide from the Grading method drop-down menu.

Step 5 - Click Save and display.

Step 6 -  Define a new grading form. Open the assessment you want and click on the :gear: icon to select advanced grading. Select Define new grading form from scratch.

 

Step 7 - On the Define marking record page, type a marking record Name and, if necessary, a Description

Step 8 - On the Marking record section, click where indicated to type:

     Criterion name (explain what a student needs to demonstrate such as Clear, concise and logical development of the work with accurate referencing using a recognised referencing system. Criteria should be written clearly and in a language that makes them easy for students to understand)

    Description for Students: You can provide students with further guidance on how to meet the criterion.

    Description for Markers: Information that only markers will see. Assessment criteria should be the same for both markers and students, but occasionally you might want to provide a model answer for markers.

     Maximum mark for this aspect of the assignment.

Repeat the steps above until you have recorded all criteria and their associated marks.

Step 9 - Under marking record options, ensure that Show marking record definition to students and Show marks per criterion to students are ticked as students must be able to see these.

Step 10 -  Click Save marking record and make it ready  or Save as draft

 
Tell students how to view the marking record

To view the marking record you’ve created for an assignment, students should:

Step 1 - On the module home page, open the assignment.

Step 2 - The Marking record and maximum marks displays on the Submission status page.

 
Edit or delete a marking record

Step 1 - Open the assignment.

Step 2 - On the assignment’s home page, in the Settings menu, click Assignment administration and then Advanced grading. 

Step 3 - Click Save or  Save as draft

When an assignment has been marked using a marking record you are editing, when you click Save the following message displays, asking whether the assignments require regrading as a result of your changes.
"
Adding Activities & Resources,IT_Helpdesk,"In Moodle, activities are the ways students interact with a course. Quizzes, glossaries, forums, and assignments are all generally called ‘activities.’

Resources are items that you can use to augment training. They can be documents or presentations, or even an external web page such as a certain video from YouTube.

To add an activity or a resource:

Step 1 - Turn on editing mode by clicking the :gear: icon in the upper right.

 

When editing is enabled, there’s a + Add an activity or resource after each section of a course.

Step 2 - Click on the + Icon, and you’ll see a pop-up window with the list of all available options and their descriptions. There are 14 types of activities and 7 types of resources.

 
Adding an activity or resource in Moodle

Step 3 - When you have chosen which type of activity or resource you’d like to use, you will be taken directly to the activity/resource’s editing page.

 
How to add a quiz

Step 1 - Choose a section where you’d like to add a quiz, click + Add an activity or resource, and choose Quiz in the pop-up window. After doing this, you get a quiz settings menu.

 


 

Step 2 - Fill in the name of the quiz. Then you can click Save and return to the the course since Name is the only field required for creating a shell for a quiz. However, feel free to explore other settings in this menu. For example, you can set time frames for assessment or limit the number of attempts allowed.

 

Step 3 - Fill this empty quiz shell with some questions. Click Edit quiz and, in a new window, click Add → + a new question.

 

In Moodle, there are 15 types of questions you can use, such as multiple-choice, matching, and drag and drop.

Step 4 - Choose the type you’d like to use and click Add.

 

 

Step 5 - In a new window, you’ll need to fill out the details of the question: its name, question text, answers, and feedback. The interface is quite self-explanatory, but in case you have trouble, there are detailed step-by-step instructions on how to create quizzes in Moodle.

 

Step 6 - Confirm your details and click Save changes. Again, you’ll find yourself in a quiz editing menu where you can repeat the same sequence of actions and add as many questions as you need.

An alternative way to create content for Moodle,IT_Helpdesk,"While Moodle is a versatile platform with rich authoring features, its interface can be, well, not really difficult but somewhat overwhelming, especially if you’re new to the system. Forget the need to check whether the editing mode is on every time you want to change something. Its design capabilities are also limited. So if you need to develop professional eLearning content quicker and easier, there’s iSpring Suite, a fully Moodle-compatible authoring tool.

iSpring Suite works as an add-in to PowerPoint. It enriches a familiar PowerPoint interface with special features for developing eLearning content. With its help, you can create interactive e-courses, quizzes, software simulations, YouTube-style video lectures, and dialog simulations — each of the items can be published as a SCORM package and easily uploaded to Moodle.

In this blog post, you’ll find a detailed step-by-step tutorial on making a course with Moodle and the same course with iSpring Suite.

Managing Learners

Now, when your course is ready, it’s time to invite some learners to explore the content.

Step 1 - First, let’s set up the enrollment methods. Within a course, choose the Participants tab in the left menu, then click a gear icon in the upper right and select Enrolment methods from a drop-down menu.

 

 

There are three enrollment methods available:

    Manual enrolment

    Guest access

    Self enrolment

By default, the only option enabled is manual enrollment. If you’d like to activate self enrolment or guest access,

Step 2 - Click the eye icon. If you also click the :gear: icon next to the eye:eye: , you’ll be able to set up some additional settings such as enrolment duration, enrolment password, or the maximum number of users.

Customizing Your Teacher Profile,IT_Helpdesk,"Your teacher profile is available to your learners and colleagues, so it’s a good opportunity to introduce yourself, prove that you’re a human being and not a chatbot, and earn some trust from the students.

Step 1 - Click :bust_in_silhouette: Profile in the upper right corner.
You’ll get to your personal page where you can edit personal information, add a photo, and create an introduction.

 

Step 2 - Click Edit profile to do this.

 

There, you can enter some text about yourself (or record a video introduction, if you like), place a photo, and leave additional contact information.

 

Step 3 - Click on Update profile once done to save your changes

 "
How to add an assignment,IT_Helpdesk,"Creating assignments is a feature that you’ll likely use very often as a teacher. With its help, you can ask your students to submit their homework, check how well the unit is being digested, and provide feedback.

Step 1- Just like with quizzes, choose the section where you’d like to add the activity, click + Add an activity or resource, and choose Assignment in the pop-up window.

 

Step 2 - In a new window, give the assignment a name and specify what you expect your students to do in a description field. For instance, you can ask them to watch a video and share their opinion on the topic, or ask them to edit a text and submit an improved version, as we did in our example.

 

There are also a number of useful settings that are worth playing with. We’ll mention just a few basic ones.

 
Availability

In this section, you can set time frames for submitting assignments or set a reminder to check students’ work before a certain date.

 
Submission types

In this section, you’ll need to specify in what format you expect the students to submit their work. Choose Online text if you want them to type their responses right in Moodle, File submissions if you want them to attach a file, or both options at the same time.

 

You can also specify certain file formats and the number of words in essays for the Online Text option.

Step 3 - Click Save and return to course when you’re done.

 "
How to create groups,IT_Helpdesk,"For more convenience, you can also divide the enrolled users into groups. It’s especially useful when you have different classes that study the same course, or there’s another teacher assigned to this course, so you would like to split the learners.
To create a group:

Step 1 - Click on the :gear: icon in the upper “Create group."" After that, name the group, set a picture, enable group messaging if you like, and click Save changes.

 

 

Step 2 - Again, in a new window, select the group from the list and click Add/remove users from the right. You’ll see the list of users enrolled in the course; select those who you’d like to add to the group and click Add in the middle.

 

 

 "
How to enroll students in a course,IT_Helpdesk,"Usually, teachers don’t have to add users to the system, because the list of users is pre-loaded by an admin or a manager. So, to enroll students in your course:

Step 1 - Choose the Participants tab in the left menu.

 

Step 2 - Click Enroll users in the upper right area, and then, in a pop-up window, select users or groups of users from the drop-down lists.

 

Step 3 - When you have finished, click Enroll selected users and cohorts.

 "
How to grade learners’ assignments,IT_Helpdesk,"To grade assignments, you need to choose the one you’d like to begin with. You can do this in several ways, but let’s go the most direct way and choose.

Step 1 - Click on Grades in the left menu, and then find an activity you’d like to grade in the row and click on it.

 

You’ll get to the grading summary page with two options: View all submissions or Grade.

 

Step 2 - To begin with, click ""View all submissions.” After doing so, you’ll see the list of all enrolled users and their submissions (or lack thereof). For more convenience, you can assign statuses, so it’s always clear to you which work still needs marking or review.

 

Step 3 - Click Grade if you’re ready to begin reviewing some students’ assignments. The grade book’s interface allows you to leave annotations, text comments, mark with colors, and put various stamps as feedback.

Step 4 - Enter the grade for the student’s submission in the right panel, change the status.

 

Step 5 - Click Save changes to quit or Save and show next to proceed.

How to message students,IT_Helpdesk,"In Moodle, you can communicate with your learners and colleagues, just like in WhatsApp. In the upper ribbon, there’s a bubble icon that opens the list of your contacts.

You can send private messages to users as well as group messages, which is a very convenient feature when you need to quickly discuss something, inform someone, or share an insight.
Click the :speech_left: icon at the top right."
How to set up a course structure,IT_Helpdesk,"In Moodle, four types of course formats define the outline
Single activity format

 Suitable when you have just one activity or resource to study. For example, a survey, a book, or a video lecture. Also, choose this format if you have a SCORM package.

You can use a single activity format to assign learners some readings
Topics format

Organizes content into different sections (lessons, units, or whatever you prefer to call it).

Topics are the most popular format for organizing an eLearning course
Weekly format

This is similar to the topics format, but instead of units, you’ll have weeks. This is a good option for you if you’d like to set a regular learning pace for your students.

You can rename dates into Week 1, Week 2, and so forth, to make a course more reusable
Social format 

If you choose this format, then you’ll have a forum instead of traditional units. This is a good choice when you need informal learning and would like to encourage discussions between learners.

Who said that learning platforms are only for e-courses? Forums are super useful for helping learners to get to know each other and allow productive informal communication

Step 1 - Open the course shell you’re going to fill with the learning content and activities. Click the :gear: icon in the upper right and turn on the editing mode.

 

Step 2 - Click the :gear: icon again and choose Edit settings from the drop-down menu.

 

Step 3 - Scroll down the course settings to the Course format section and choose the format you’d like to proceed with.

 

Then click Save and display at the bottom of the page.

 "
How to set up a grade book,IT_Helpdesk,"A grade book is a Moodle feature that helps you collect scores for graded activities in your course. With its help, you can collect and view marks and manually enter grades for offline activities.

To set up a grade book for a course:

Step 1 - Click on the gear icon in the upper right and select Grade book setup. On a new page, you’ll see the full list of graded items for the course.

 

 

For each item, there’s a Weights column. The bigger the number, the more important the grade for performing this task (more on that in a minute).

For now, let’s make grade book items l “Add category."" In the demo course we use, there are three types of graded items, so we can create three categories for them:

    Assignment

    Quiz

    Simulation

 

In your course, you can create any number of graded item types and as many categories as you need.

Step 2 - After clicking Add category, give each created category a name and click Save changes.

 

Step 3 - Now, move the items to their category by clicking the arrow icon on the left of the item’s name.

Now, when your items are organized, it’s easier to assign the weights to each category. Let’s say, we believe Assignment to be the most important category, so we’d like to give it the largest weight. For example, it’s 50. We tick a checkbox for Assignment and enter 50.

All the other weights are automatically adjusted, so the sum is 100, but you can define weights for the rest of the categories too — in our example, we put 30 and 20 for Quiz and Simulation correspondingly.

If you like, you can also manually define weights for each item within a category.

 

Step 4 - When everything is ready, click Save changes in the left bottom.

 "
Track activity completion,IT_Helpdesk,"This guide explains how to view activity completion progress as a teacher using the activity completion report and as a student on the course home page.

 Activity completion must be enabled for the Moodle space and the appropriate activities.
Activity completion icons

Activity completion icons, or check boxes, give a visual indication of the current activity status. They provide information on whether this is manually by the participant or automatic based on criteria set by a user with editing rights.

The following icons appear on both the activity completion report and the course homepage.

    :woman_teacher: Viewing the Activity completion report (for teachers)

    :man_student: Viewing activity completion in a Moodle space (for students)

:woman_teacher: Viewing the Activity completion report (for teachers)

Step 1- Click on the :gear: gear icon  to open the actions menu.

Step 2 - Select  'More...' at the bottom of the menu.

Step 3 - Select Reports.

 Step 4 - Select 'Activity completion' in the Reports section.

The Activity completion report will open. Participants are listed in rows and activities with activity completion enabled appear as columns to the right. Each activity has a checkbox for each participant which gives a visual indication of their completion status.

 

Hover over the icons to see summary information about the participant, activity and current status e.g. 'Simon Singh, Mahara Assignment 101: Not completed'.

Users with editing rights are able to manually check and uncheck activity completion boxes in the report if required.
:man_student: Viewing activity completion in a Moodle space (for students)

Students can track their progress from the course page. The icons appear on the right-hand side of activities that have had activity completion tracking enabled.

If there is no tick box then, completion tracking is not available for the activity.

The tick boxes will update when clicked on (for manual completion) or automatically when the relevant completion criteria are met e.g. when the activity is viewed, an entry is added, or a submission is made depending on the type of activity. In the event that this does not seem to be working, the student should contact the module lecturer for advice."
Why does my Turnitin Assignment show a ‘Read Only’ mode?,IT_Helpdesk,"    You may have tried to access a Turnitin Assignment in order to provide feedback, or grade a submission.

    A student may have tried to submit a paper.

However,  you are prevented from doing so since the class has apparently expired and is currently ‘read only’.
Read Only lock

 
Why does this message appear?

When a Teacher creates a Turnitin assignment (using the Moodle Direct v2 plugin) for the first time within a Moodle course, a Turnitin class is also created for that course on the Turnitin database. This class has a default end date which is typically six months from the creation date, or it is set to the date of the latest post-date for the Turnitin assignments in the class. Once the end date is reached, the class becomes “expired,” which means any submissions in the class are read-only.

Any student enrolled in an expired class will NOT count against the Institution’s Turnitin student limit.
How do I change the class from ‘expired’ to ‘active’?

It is not possible to change the default class end date in the Moodle integration. However you can take the following steps to extend the class end date so the class becomes active once more:

Step 1 - Login to Moodle

Step 2 -  Navigate to the relevant Moodle course

Step 3 - Open the relevant Turnitin assignment in the course

Step 4 - Edit the Post Date to a date in the future.  This will cause the class end date to be extended so the class becomes active again.

Step 5 - Change the post date back to whatever you would like it to be."
Turnitin error: M14: 11 Your Session Has Expired. This paper is not available.,IT_Helpdesk,"When trying to open submission in moodle, students and staff may occasionally come across the so-called M14 error.
:info: Reasons

Turnitin’s own technical support team has suggested that this error indicates one of the following has occurred:

    A paper can fail to process correctly if it contains complex content such as dense vector images that take too long to process. To work around this issue the student is advised to replace any vector images (Examples of Vector graphics are: AI, EPS, WMF, and PICT (Mac)) in their paper with raster images (jpg/jpeg, psd, png, tiff, bmp and gif).

    Some PowerPoint templates may include vector images.

    Use of a third-party pdf converter/converter other than the in-built MS Office O365 one.

    Also, Turnitin has suggested that if the first page of a paper includes an image without text, the processing process is sometimes aborted which makes the paper inaccessible.

    Includes text with visual effects such as 3D glow or shadow. 

    The file is password protected.

Check whether any of the above applies, address the issue in question, and resubmit your paper.

If none of the above applies to your paper, please convert it into a pdf and resubmit it.  The paper will often be processed correctly the second time around.

    If the error persists, contact our Virtual Help Centre and open a ticket with IT Helpdesk

:ballot_box_with_check: Past the deadline

Contact our Virtual Help Centre and open a ticket with IT Helpdesk. We will either fix the issue for you, or will liaise with Turnitin’s own technical support team on your behalf.
:man_office_worker: Staff
:ballot_box_with_check: Prior to the due date

Download the original file submitted by the student.
Click on the student’s assignment and it will automatically download/open in your browser.

 

Check if any of the reasons listed above apply (too many pictures on the first few pages, wrong format etc.).

    If any of the above apply, ask the student to fix the issue (provided you know who it is) and resubmit or do it yourself assignment inbox settings permitting. If anonymous marking is enabled, you will be better off asking the student to resubmit their paper.

    If none of the above apply, ask the student to save their paper as a pdf or Zip then resubmit or do it on their behalf assignment settings permitting.

:ballot_box_with_check: Past the deadline

 

    OPTION 1 – keep original submission date & time stamp only works for papers without any of the above-listed reasons of errors above 

    Download the originally submitted file off Moodle and check whether any of the obvious above mentioned reasons apply after all: pictures on the front page saved as .odt, pictures only and missing text, etc.

    If the submission looks perfectly fine to you, do the following: Log in to your Native Turnitin Account or request from the Library assistant then locate the relevant submission. If the inbox is anonymized you may have to cross-check submission titles and date/time stamp to identify the correct submission. Alternatively, you may need to de-anonymize the name of that particular student only.

    If you hover over the black exclamation mark if available, you should see the below message.

    Click on the exclamation mark and wait a few minutes for Turnitin to refresh the submission. Refresh the page and return to moodle and try to open the paper.

 

There may be several submissions with a black exclamation mark, not all of them are M14 errors. Other reasons for black exclamation marks are, for instance, word usage patterns that sometimes interfere with normal match detection = Turnitin being unable to recognize all the text in a submission. While this could be an indication of an intentional attempt to avoid similarity checking, it also occurs when converting files to PDF.

M14 errors on the TurnitinUK website can be identified by either a missing pencil icon or two dashes instead of a similarity percentage.

    OPTION 2 – if option 1 didn’t fix the issue, the black exclamation mark was not available or any of the above errors apply to the paper

    Failing option 1, download a copy of the original paper off Moodle. You’ll find that in most instances, any of the above-listed reasons apply.

    Ask the student to fix the issue by removing pictures of the first few pages of their submission, adding more text, adding an extra slide, saving it in the correct format, etc.

    Alternatively, fix the issue on behalf of the student if you are pressed for time.

    Make a note of the date & time stamp of the original submission for marks admin. Keep a copy or forward the information to the relevant administrator or convenor.

    Upload the updated paper on behalf of the student (anonymous marking settings permitting) and test whether it is accessible.

    The paper will now show as late. Ensure you inform the relevant people to prevent the submission from being capped.

    OPTION 3- Contact our Virtual Help Centre and open a ticket with IT Helpdesk

:green_star: Turnitin Accepted File Types:

Turnitin currently accepts the following file types up to 40MB for upload into an assignment:

    Microsoft Word™ (DOC and DOCX)

    Corel WordPerfect®

    HTML

    Adobe PostScript®

    Plain text (TXT)

    Rich Text Format (RTF)

    Portable Document Format (PDF)

    Microsoft PowerPoint (PPT, PPTX, and PPS) (May not generate an Originality Report) Turnitin converts the PowerPoint slide deck into a static PDF, leaving all text and images in their original format but leaving out features such as presenter notes, embedded video, and animations. Text with visual effects is not supported, and it is recommended that any visual effects such as shadows and 3-D be removed prior to submitting to Turnitin.

    Hangul (HWP)

    Microsoft Excel® (.xls and .xlsx). The version of the file that can be viewed in GradeMark will look the same as it would if the Excel file had been saved as a PDF and submitted to Turnitin. We highly recommend that students pay attention to the image preview provided in the single file submission to verify that the file is presented in an acceptable manner.  Users can adjust the way the file looks by editing the page setup and print area settings for the file prior to saving it and submitting it to Turnitin.

For assignments that accept any file types the following image file types can be displayed and rendered in GradeMark, but will not generate an Originality Report:

    JPEG

    GIF

    PNG

    TIFF

    BMP

    PICT

:cross_mark: Non-supported file types

    Microsoft® Works (.wps) file types.

    Apple Pages file types.

    Spreadsheets created outside of Microsoft Excel (i.e. .ods).

    GDOC files (.gdoc) which are just links to online Google Document files, but don’t actually contain text or the document’s content. Google Drive must be used to upload Google Docs.

    Microsoft Word 2007 macros-enabled (.docm) files

    Zip files

All other file types that are not one of the file formats listed above will be accepted by Turnitin when the setting for Allow submission of any file type is set to Yes, but the file may not be displayed in GradeMark. When files cannot be displayed in GradeMark, Lecturers and Tutors are still able to download the original files.
:warning: File names

Punctuation in file names can generate errors when submitted to Turnitin. When students name their Turnitin assignment files, they should avoid using any punctuation except underscore ‘_’.
:warning: Turnitin and Nova Fonts
Students using Windows 10 and/or Microsoft Office 2016 may experience issues submitting work to Turnitin if using one of the new fonts such as Arial Nova. A workaround to this would be to ask students to change the font to a type commonly used in previous versions of Word (such as Arial) before submission to Turnitin."

Is forwarding an email to respective Virtual Help Centre service desk same as creating ticket on behalf of the reporter?,IT_Helpdesk,"No, it is not same as creating ticket on behalf of the reporter. Why? Let’s look at a case scenario below to better understand. 

For example; You are an agent for Academic Administration service desk and you receive an email enquiry to your work email inbox from a student. When you forward this email to admin@apu.edu.my, it will create a ticket on Virtual Help Centre - Academic Administration. The reporter of this ticket enquiry will be you because the email forwarder (sender) to admin@apu.edu.my is from your email address that created ticket instead of student email. 

Even though you can change the reporter after ticket creation on Agent Portal from your email to student email, the student will not know that you have created a ticket on behalf of the student on Virtual Help Centre - Academic Administration, only if you reply to the ticket. The first time a ticket is created on Virtual Help Centre, it will send email notification to reporter that a ticket have been created but, in this case it will send this notification to you because originally this ticket was created with your email address (email forwarder). See the screenshot of ticket history below.


As you can see that ticket was originally created by ismail@staffemail.apu.edu.my and the user received email notification that a ticket have been created. Later, this ticket reporter is changed from ismail@staffemail.apu.edu.my to Mohammad Reza Ganji and as mentioned above the new reporter will not receive notification because Mohammad Reza Ganji is not original reporter of this ticket.

Software Compatibility for M-series Mac,IT_Helpdesk,"Quick Reference Guide: Software Compatibility

For any inquiries, we recommend initiating a ticket with the Virtual Help Centre. An alternative route for guidance and support is through APSpace > More > Help Centre. This guide is intended to streamline the process of opening a ticket for your convenience.

In terms of software compatibility, Microsoft SQL Server with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) has an equivalent alternative in Azure SQL Edge and Azure Data Studio, while Visual Studio IDE has counterparts in Visual Studio for Mac (with no support for C, C++) and Visual Studio Code with limited C, C++ support.

IBM SPSS Amos is currently unsupported, and SOLIDWORKS lacks virtualized support but is compatible with native environments. Microsoft Project and Microsoft Visio are unsupported on virtualized platforms but supported in native environments. SQL Accounting, SQL Payroll, Sage UBS Accounting, Sage UBS Inventory and Billing, and Sage UBS Payroll are all unsupported in virtualized environments but supported natively.

Notably, TASM (or any assembler) lacks support across the board. It is unsupported natively, virtually, and on MacOS.

It's worth mentioning that an unofficial script exists for Microsoft SQL Server and SSMS installation, tested on the UTM environment. SOLIDWORKS shows no evidence of missing features or issues when running on ARM64, and TASM assembler can be emulated via DOSBox using a Visual Studio Code extension, with no information on any missing instruction set.

Step 2: In the top navigation, select Download. (You can also right-click the file, photo, or folder, and select Download.)



The Download button will only appear when files or folders are selected.
Usability Guidelines 
The Download button may sometimes disappear if you refresh the web page while looking at a folder. To work around this, you can go up one level in the folder directory and come back, or close that tab in your browser and navigate to the folder again.If your browser prompts you, choose Save or Save As and browse to the location where you want to save the download. (Some browsers just start saving right away to a Downloads folder on your computer.)

If you need to free up space on your OneDrive, download your file or folder to a location outside of your OneDrive folders (see below). You can then delete the OneDrive copy of the file or folder to reduce your storage amount.

For more information, see Delete files or folders in OneDrive.

If you select multiple files or folders and then select Download, your browser will start downloading a .zip file containing all the files and folders you selected. If you're in a folder and you select Download without selecting any files or folders, your browser will begin downloading all contents of the folder.

You can't download files directly from the Shared view. You will need to open the file and save a copy in the location of your choice.

You can't download OneNote notebooks. If you download a folder that contains a OneNote notebook, the .zip file will contain an error message in the form of a .txt file.

The Download button may sometimes disappear if you refresh the web page while looking at a folder. To work around this, you can go up one level in the folder directory and come back, or close that tab in your browser and navigate to the folder again.

All about Outlook archive,IT_Helpdesk,"All Outlook inboxes have storage space of 50 GB. When your mailbox is reaching the storage limit, you will not be able to send or receive any mail. Other than clearing your deleted mailbox, you may consider archiving old emails to free up storage space from your mailbox.Creating Outlook archive
To clean up your mailbox and free up space, use the Outlook cleanup tool. The tool will archive any email older than the specified date and export it to a file, and the email will be removed from your mailbox.

You can only create archive files using the old Outlook client. 

If you are using the New Outlook, please switch to old Outlook client before creating the archive files. To switch back to old Outlook client, click on the New Outlook toggle on the top right.


Step 1: Click on File.


Step 2: In File page, click on Tools, then click Clean Up Old Items.


Step 3: Configure the archive options.


You will need to choose the folder to archive emails, determine the cut-off point for archival, and select location to put your archive file.

To archive entire mailbox, click on your mailbox account.
If you want to archive just a specific folder, such as Inbox, click on the folder.

You should change cut-off point date to the point where you want to start archiving and removing the emails from your mailbox. 
For example, in the above screenshot, any emails received before 12 July 2023 will be archived. 

Click on Browse to change the location of the archive file, do rename it to something recognizable to allow for future reference.


Step 4: Wait for the archiving process to complete.


Result: Once the archive process is complete, you will notice that emails older than the cut-off point are removed from your mailbox. The mailbox storage will be free up depending on how much email you archived.


You can check the archive file at the location you selected previously. The file size will tell you rough approximation on how much storage you free up from mailbox.


Viewing Outlook archive
Sometimes, you may need to view the archived emails. You can do so by opening the archive file using Outlook client.

Step 1: Click on File, under Open & Export, click Open Outlook Data File.


Step 2: Browse for the archive you want to view.


Step 3: Outlook will open the archive under a separate category. You can then browse through the email using this view.


Step 4: To close the Archive file, right click on the archive folder, then click Close.


Creating Outlook archive by year (Advanced)
If you want to organize the email by only archiving the emails received in the same year into the same archive file, you may move all the emails into a custom folder first, then use the Archive tool to archive the folder. 

In this guide, we will explore the method of archiving all emails received in the year 2019 using search tool.

Archiving by year allows for more organized archive file, but the process is tedious and will take a while for larger mailbox. Occasional errors may occur as Outlook will need to sync with the Exchange server to process these changes.

Please plan ahead and do this when you are not using Outlook, ideally at the beginning of the year. 

Step 1: Right click on Archive, select New Folder.

Step 2: Enter the year name. 


Step 3: Click on the search bar on top, then click on the down arrow to show the filter menu.


Step 4: Change the Received date to the start and end of the year you want to archive.


Step 5: Examine the search results.


Not all search results will be populated on the first search. Here’s how to tell if Outlook haven’t finish searching all mails within the year:

Check the bottom left corner on the number of results found. Usually, all results count should not be a multiple of 100, but instead at an arbitrary number like 2,123.


Scroll to the bottom of the search results. If Outlook is still searching, it means not all results are populated.


Step 6: Click on one of the emails, then press Ctrl + A to select all emails. 

Step 7: Right click on one of the emails, select Move, then choose the archive folder to move to.

Step 8: Click OK to start moving the emails.

Junk folder can also be a source of problem when normal emails start going to it. Here, we will discuss the problem of Microsoft 365 emails going to Spam folder and its solutions. First, let us go through some user queries regarding Microsoft 365 email going to spam issue:

User Query
Query 1:
We use Outlook Microsoft 365 in our University as official email. For last few days, I was not receiving any emails. When I personally contacted my supervisor, he told me that he had sent me 4/5 emails but got no reply. Hearing this, I checked my junk folder and saw all emails going to Junk folder in Microsoft 365. I was wondering what led to this situation. I have obviously not marked his emails as junk before but still Microsoft 365 email goes to junk folder. That day I have marked his emails as ‘Not Spam’ but it is not working. I still have to check my junk folder to get his emails. Please help so that my internal emails going to junk folder Microsoft 365 could be stopped.

 

Query 2:
From last month, installment payment reminder mail from my bank is going to junk folder of Microsoft 365 email. For this reasons I almost missed my last installment. To avoid the same of Microsoft 365 email going to spam this month, I have included that id into safe senders list. Unfortunately for me, this method did not work and even now my emails going to junk folder - Outlook 2013. Can anyone tell me how to stop internal emails going to junk folder office 365?

Legitimate Emails going to Junk folder
Having legitimate emails going to Junk folder is no less annoying than having spam email in your Inbox. Have a look at the reasons behind this problem briefly and then move to solution part. This issue occurs when Microsoft 365 considers emails from trusted sources as spam. This results in legitimate emails ending up in Junk folder. During this situation, users have to check junk folder to see if it contains any legitimate emails. To get rid internal emails going to junk folder Microsoft 365 issue, users can apply these techniques.

Manual Methods to Stop Emails Going to Spam Folder
There are a number of ways to stop legitimate emails going to Junk. In this segment, readers will learn these methods to stop internal emails going to junk folder in Microsoft 365 account.

Step 1: Configure Spam Filter Policy: First, users should verify ‘Advanced Spam Filter’ policies to check if an entire domain has been blocked. If yes, then all emails coming from that particular domain will go to Junk. Users can disable advanced spam filtering options that cause such problem. Users can also create ‘Safe Senders List’ in Microsoft 365 to stop Microsoft 365 email going to spam by going to Settings>> Options>> Block or Allow. Note that Exchange Online Protection (EOP) does not keep track of domains. It keeps only senders and recipients.


Step 2: Using Directory Synchronization: This technique is applicable only to active staff and students. Usually, Microsoft 365 email users are by default protected by Exchange Online Protection (EOP). In case of EOP-only subscribers, they can use director synchronization to fix this problem. Directory synchronization allows users to synchronize their own settings with EOP services. Thus EOP will have access to user’s ‘Safe Senders List’ and function accordingly.


Step 3: Setting Connection Filter’s IP Allow list: To fix false negative issue of Microsoft 365 emails to Junk, users can add senders’ IP addresses to IP allow list of connection filter. When users enable ‘Safe List Only’ option, they receive emails sent by the enlisted senders only to their inbox. In this case, adding IP address cannot eliminate the problem completely. As Microsoft 365 email going to spam can’t be relinquish with IP.

How to add an IP address to IP Allow list of Connection Filter
Step 1: By extracting header of emails sent by preferred senders from Outlook or OWA.

By following the manual in ‘Use the EAC to change the default connection filter policy.

By manually finding IP address with Message Analyzer tab of Remote Connectivity. Analyzer. Users can also use CIP tag of X-Forefront-Antispam-Report header.


Step 2: Verifying Junk Email Setting to stop internal emails going to Junk folder Microsoft 365: Users can execute the below command to check the configuration setting of junk mail.Here,If TrustedListsOnly value is true, the setting is enabled. If ContactsTrusted value is true, user trusts both Contacts and Safe Senders.TrustedSendersAndDomains value shows contents of the user’s Safe Senders Lists.


Step 3: Using Safe Senders List: Web Outlook users can use this method to stop emails from ending up in Junk folder. If there is a message with yellow colored safety tip, it means the email is in junk folder. Users can check the header of email whether it still contains SFV:SKN or SFV:NSPM stamp. It happens because Outlook ‘Safe Lists Only’ setting overrides the EOP setting. In case emails are going to junk folder irrespective of marking, turn off the option ‘Safe Lists Only:






How can I stop Outlook or OWA putting incoming email into the Junk E-Mail folder?


Step 1: Click on the Junk tool button in the toolbar near the top left of the Outlook window.

Step 2: Click to select Junk E-Mail Options.



 

Step 3: Click the topmost option, labeled No Automatic Filtering.

Dealing with slow/reduced Bandwidth when using Microsoft Teams "
Dealing with slow/reduced Bandwidth when using Microsoft Teams,IT_Helpdesk,"One of the challenges educators and students might face when using Microsoft Teams from your respective locations especially when out of campus would be dealing with slow/reduced bandwidth.

Below are the suggested workarounds:

The solution to the challenge above would be to “Turn off” the video when not required. You are advised to use audio with screen sharing if bandwidth is an issue.

You are advised not to play any video during the screen sharing with audio mode. The screen sharing is ideally used to beam the presentation slides along with living demos (if any). If there are any videos to be played, do share the video link with students and get them to view from their side. You may post the video link in the respective channel within your Class Teams.

Microsoft Teams Meeting Recordings will be stored in Onedrive and Sharepoint after 7th July 2021.,IT_Helpdesk,"Microsoft is changing the location where Microsoft Teams meeting recordings are stored. After 7th July 2021, recordings of your Microsoft Teams meetings will be stored either in Teams Channel or OneDrive which previously were automatically stored in Microsoft Stream (Ref: Use OneDrive for Business and SharePoint for meeting recordings - Microsoft Teams | Microsoft Docs ).  As a result, location of the meeting recording will be changed as follows:

Recordings for Scheduled Meetings in a Teams Channel
 For meetings scheduled in a Teams Channel including your online/remote classes, or started using Meet Now in a Teams Channel, your recorded lecture videos will be stored in the files section of that Channel under a folder called Recordings (Eg: Teams name - Channel name/Documents/Recordings) .It will be available to all members of that particular Team. Lecturers are responsible to  publish/share the link of recorded lecture videos on relevant section in Moodle Platform and  ensure  the videos are accessible not less than 6 month from the published date.

Recordings for Scheduled Meetings NOT in a Teams Channel
Recordings of regular meetings not scheduled in a Teams Channel, including 1-on-1 calls and multi-person chats, will be stored in a folder called Recordings in the OneDrive of the person who started the recording (eg: recorder's OneDrive for Business/Recordings). The recording will automatically be shared with all APU  participants of the meeting including students. If there were external participants to the meeting, a link to the recording must be manually shared with them via the normal OneDrive/SharePoint sharing mechanism.

Why the change?
This change brings some improvements to the way videos are stored and shared:

Recordings will be available directly in OneDrive/SharePoint instead of requiring accessing to the Stream portal. OneDrive and SharePoint provide simpler sharing options than the Stream portal.  

Provides the ability to share recordings with external users.

Saved recordings will be made available more quickly than those currently being saved to Stream.

FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions 
Questions

Answers

Questions

Answers

How will my storage quota be impacted?

Teams meeting recording files live will be stored on your OneDrive@APU and SharePoint which, quota for those services can  be increased if required .

When Stream files (such as recordings) are stored in SharePoint/OneDrive, how is it decided where they go? Does the admin have the ability to change where it goes?

By default, all recording files will go to the OneDrive account of the user who selected Record. For channel meetings, the recording will always go to the SharePoint site of the channel. The admin can't change where the recording is stored.

Who has the permissions to view the meeting recording?

For non-Channel meetings, all meeting invitees, except for external users, will automatically get a personally shared link. External users will need to be explicitly added to the shared list by the meeting organizer or the person who started the meeting recording. For Channel meetings, permissions are inherited from the owner and members list in the channel.

How long should I keep recorded lecture video files on my OneDrive@APU?

Your recorded lecture videos on your OneDrive@APU  must be kept minimum 6 months.

How can I play a Teams meeting recording?

Your video will play on the video player of OneDrive@APU or SharePoint depending on where you access the file.

Is Microsoft  plan on deprecating adding to Stream? If yes, will existing videos stay as is and for how long?

Stream as a platform won't be deprecated in the near future. The videos that currently live in Stream will stay there until we start migrating. Upon migration, those videos will be migrated to OneDrive  or SharePoint as well.

What happens to my Office365@APU including emails and office applications after I graduate?,IT_Helpdesk,"As a student at APU, you may have availed the privilege of utilizing Microsoft 365, which includes apps like Word and Excel for your personal devices and OneDrive for online file storage. This access has been made possible due to the institution's acquisition of licenses, enabling students and staff to use these services free of charge.

However, it is crucial to be aware that this access will undergo changes upon your departure from APU. After your official graduation date, which is indicated on your diploma or degree, you will retain access to Microsoft 365 as part of the active APU student group for approximately one year. During this temporary extension, your access to email and IT services will remain unchanged.

Once this period expires, your access to all Microsoft 365 applications, including Outlook, OneDrive, and Teams, will be revoked, leading to the unavailability of your files and emails. To retain access to Microsoft 365 beyond this point, you will have the option to subscribe to the service directly from Microsoft.

In the event that you do not intend to purchase a subscription to continue using Microsoft 365, it is highly recommended that you take proactive measures to safeguard your files. This entails downloading all your files from OneDrive@APU and Outlook@APU and storing them securely elsewhere.

Ensuring the proper management of your files and subscriptions is imperative for maintaining the continuity of your digital assets and communication channels.

 

Backing up your OneDrive data is easy. Here are the steps:
Step 1: Login to Microsoft 365 on the web.

Step 2: Go to the app launcher and select OneDrive.

Step 3: Select the folders or files you want to download, then Click the Download button. The files will be saved to the Downloads folder on your computer in a .ZIP format.

The detailed steps is accessible at Downloading OneDrive data.

Given that it is difficult to know how Microsoft may change its licensing in the future, we recommend transitioning your primary email to a personal email account (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) or at least having a secondary email account as a backup.

Alumni may purchase Home or Personal Office subscriptions directly from Microsoft.

Google Docs and OpenOffice provide free options for Office-type applications.

Important: Remember to set a strong password for the Server Administrator (SA) account or the SQL Server will not run!

Preface
To setup SQL Server in your workstation, you need to have at least the core function installed. The SQL Server installer will install the back-end service(s) that handle the database, while SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is responsible for providing the interface to access and interact with the database. Everything you do will go through a database manager before the changes are reflected in the database.

"Are you experiencing a slow Wi-Fi connection when many students are using Microsoft Teams in the same area, such as large classrooms or auditoriums?",IT_Helpdesk,"There are several factors that can contribute to slow Internet Wi-Fi when many students using Microsoft Teams in the same area such as large classrooms. Here are some possible explanations:

Multicast packet
Microsoft Teams using multicast packets during video streaming for some of its functionalities or features, such as its network diagnostics tool. The tool uses multicast packets to measure network performance by sending test traffic to multiple destinations on the network and measuring the response time. Additionally, some network devices, such as wireless access points and switches, may use multicast packets for internal communication related to Teams traffic. As a result, the total amount of airtime available which is fixed due to nature Wi-Fi Technology, can run out (or reach 100% utilization).

Limited Wi-Fi airtime:
Unlike wired network, Wi-Fi is a shared (and half-duplex) medium, meaning that all devices operating on the same channel must compete (or contend) for the same limited airtime, and only one device can “talk” at any given moment. Therefore, you need to wait for your turn to send or receive data via Wi-Fi,where only one device “talks” at a time, and must contend with each other for their opportunity to transmit or receive. Obviously, the more devices connected to Microsoft Teams via Wi-Fi, the more contention occurs, which can slow down the network.

Wi-Fi Bandwidth limitations
 The amount of data that can be transmitted over a wireless network is limited by the Wi-Fi bandwidth available. When many people are using the same network simultaneously, they are all competing for the same bandwidth, over a limited airtime which can slow down the network. This is particularly true if multiple people are trying to stream video such as Microsoft Teams or upload/download large files at the same time.

Congestion
When many people are using the same wireless network, the network can become congested, which can slow down speeds. This can be particularly true if multiple people are using bandwidth-intensive applications, such as video conferencing like Microsoft Teams.

Outdated hardware
If the students are using outdated hardware, such as old laptops or smartphones, they may not be able to take advantage of the latest Wi-Fi technologies such as Wi-Fi 6, which can result in slower speeds.


In a summary, Microsoft Teams is a platform that enables video conferencing and collaboration. To join a Teams call, only one device in a room or classroom needs to be connected to the platform. This prevents audio interference and helps to avoid slowing down the Wi-Fi for other online activities, like taking notes on Microsoft Note. As a result, participants in the same room can remain productive during the call without interruption.

What is the difference between “Horizon Client” and “HTML Access” for VirtualLab@APU?,IT_Helpdesk,"
Interacting with VirtualLab@APU: Horizon Client vs. HTML Access

VMware provides two methods for interacting with the virtual desktop in VirtualLab@APU, each with distinct functionality and accessibility. The recommended method for the best experience is to access VirtualLab@APU using Horizon Client. However, if you don't have permission to install Horizon Client, you can still access VirtualLab@APU through HTML Access.

Functionality:

Horizon Client:

Prerequisite: Requires the installation of Horizon Client, necessitating administrative permission.
Performance: Offers a smoother performance compared to HTML Access.
File Transfer: Supports shared folders, USB redirection, and upload to OneDrive.
Multi-display: Supported for enhanced workspace.
Windows Key Action: Direct input by pressing ⊞ WIN.
Additional Functionalities: Provides additional support for Skype and Microsoft Teams, supports multimedia and browser redirection, and utilizes PCoIP and Microsoft RDP protocols.
Display Scaling: Allows synchronized key locks (CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, SCROLL LOCK).
HTML Access:

Prerequisite: Requires only a web browser, eliminating the need for administrative permission.
Performance: Generally slower compared to Horizon Client.
File Transfer: Supports upload to OneDrive.
Multi-display: Supported for extended workspace.
Windows Key Action: Simulated by pressing CTRL + ⊞ WIN.
Additional Functionalities: Limited compared to Horizon Client, lacking additional support for Skype and Microsoft Teams, and some multimedia and browser redirection features.
Display Scaling: Supported.
In summary, while both methods allow access to VirtualLab@APU, Horizon Client offers a more feature-rich and smoother experience, especially in terms of performance and additional functionalities. HTML Access serves as an alternative, more accessible option without the need for installation permissions, albeit with some limitations in functionality.

Inviting a user to join session
Step 1 - To start inviting other users to join your virtual desktop session, navigate to the tray icon area and click on the VMware Horizon Collaboration icon.


A window will pop up for you to enter the username or email address of the user you wanted to invite. 


Step 2 - Type in the TP number or username of the person you wanted to invite.


Step 3 - Once you added the list of people to invite for collaboration, click Copy Link.


Once the invitation link has been created and copied to your clipboard, you will receive a Success! message.


You need to share the invitation link to the person(s), one way you could do it is through Microsoft Teams.


You will notice the Horizon Client Session Collaboration icon appearing on the desktop as well, indicating that session collaboration has started.


Joining a collaboration session
If someone invited you to join the collaboration session, you can use the link that they sent to join session through HTML Access (web browser). If you have Horizon Client installed, you can use the client link to join instead.

If the link is not clickable, copy the URL and paste it in the browser address bar.

Action - login if you are using web browser to join the session.


If you join using Horizon Client, you will see a pop-up message in your web browser. Click Open VMware Horizon Client.


After authenticated yourself, you will be able to see the host virtual desktop session.


If you receive the following error message, it means that you are not invited to join the collaboration session or the host had removed you from the invitation. Please message the host to get a new invitation.


Managing invitation list
Step 1 - After inviting someone, clicking on the VMware Horizon Collaboration icon again will reveal the dashboard that allows you to check the person you invited and their status, as well as transferring control of virtual session and removing them from the invitation list.


Step 2 - Click on Remove next to the person will allow you to remove them from the invitation list.


Taking Control
By default, only the host has the rights to control the virtual machine. You can choose to transfer the control rights to other invited users by toggling the control to On.


Once you transferred the control rights to other user, you will not be able to interact with the program directly. However, you can take back the control rights by double-click or pressing any key on keyboard.


The invited person with the control rights can now interact with the virtual desktop session.


If you want to return the control rights to host while using Horizon Client, click on the VMware Horizon Collaboration icon in icon tray and toggle the Control switch to Off or click Give Back Control button.

On HTML Access, the only way for host to regain control rights is by double-clicking or press any key in the desktop.

 

Ending Collaboration
Clicking on End Collaboration will end the collaboration session.


You can also hover over Horizon Client Session Collaboration icon and click the box to end collaboration.

"Why am I getting ""This desktop currently has no desktop sources available"" when connecting to VirtualLab@APU?",IT_Helpdesk,"When connecting to the Windows 10 virtual machine using VMware Horizon Client or HTML Access, you encounter the following error:


The reason of this error is that VirtualLab@APU have reached its maximum number of users allowed to connect to the service. Currently, the Virtual Lab service can accommodate up to 50 simultaneous users' active sessions.

As a gentle reminder, please shutdown the virtual machine once you no longer need it to free up the resource for other users.

"I can’t install VMware Horizon Client, it says “Install Failed”.",IT_Helpdesk,"Solution 1: Run the installer with Administrative rights
The installer requires administrative permission to perform changes to your system. To run the installer with administrative permission, right click on the installer and click Run as Administrator.


Solution 2: Install without HTML5 Multimedia Redirection support
When installing the VMware Horizon Client, uncheck the option Install Support for HTML5 Multimedia Redirection and Browser Redirection, then click Install.


Solution 3: Install the latest .NET Framework
VMware Horizon Client requires .NET Framework to work properly. To ensure that your computer isn’t missing the required files, install the latest .NET Framework.

Step 1 - Go to Microsoft .NET Framework download page.

Step 2 - Click on the latest version, highlighted in yellow.


Step 3 - Click on Download .NET Framework under Runtime.


Step 4 - Your browser will download a small installer file. Run the installer.

Step 5 - Follow the instructions of the installer.

A frequently updated Windows 10 computer should have the latest .NET Framework installed, therefore you will receive this error when trying to install the framework:


Solution 4: Install the latest Visual C++ Redistributables
VMware Horizon Client requires latest version of Visual C++ Redistributables (aka vc_redist) to work properly. To ensure that your computer isn’t missing the required files, install the latest Visual C++ Redistributables.

Step 1 - Go to Visual C++ Redistributables download page.

Step 2 - Scroll to Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 and download both x86 and x64 versions.

Step 3 - Run the installers.

If the installer states that there are newer version of Visual C++ Redistributables installed, go to Control Panel and uninstall the latest version and run the installer again.

Solution 5: Disable antivirus active protection temporarily
Some user reported their antivirus software is actively blocking the installation of VMware Horizon Client, especially during the process of changing the system HOSTS file.

Step 1 - Open the taskbar tray and right click on your antivirus software.The tray is located at the bottom right of your desktop.


Step 2 - Depending on your antivirus software, you will see different options. You need to look for “Dashboard”, “Temporarily Disable Active Protection”, “Exit” or similar keywords.
You need to find a way to either temporarily disable Active Protection feature or exit the antivirus software completely (not minimize back to tray).

Step 3 - Once the antivirus software is disabled, run the installer.

Step 4 - Regardless of the outcome, please re-enable the antivirus.

If all of the above solutions failed to solve the issue, please opt for using VirtualLab@APU through HTML Access, which does not require the installation of Horizon Client."

How to configure postfix relay to Office365 on Ubuntu,IT_Helpdesk,"First we need to install postfix server and mailutils (simple mail commands that will help testing our configuration).



sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postfix mailutils

On the configuration page chose “Internet Site” and continue with the default setting in the next step. Since the whole purpose of our mail server is to just relay all messages to Office365 it is not necessary to configure external domain.

Once installation completes we need to configure postfix; open /etc/postfix/main.cf



sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
For the relayhost add smtp.office365.com and port 587



relayhost = [smtp.office365.com]:587
Since we will be using this mail server locally we want to protect it by saying that we only accept connections from localhost. So modify this two setting:



mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8
inet_interfaces = loopback-only
Normally you want to use secure connection to Office365 so it is necessary to configure postfix to use TLS. Add this code at the end of the config file and save the file.



smtp_use_tls = yes
smtp_always_send_ehlo = yes
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
Next we need to configure the sasl_passwd and generic files.

The sasl_passwd holds information for the Office365 account used to relay the emails. Create the file by typing:



sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
and add this line to the file



[smtp.office365.com]:587 username@yourdomain:office365password
Change the username@yourdomain with your account and office365password with the account password and save the file.

Next we need to set correct file permissions and hash the file for use in postfix.



sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
Next we need to configure generic file in order to be able to send emails as a valid user (this is required for Office365).



sudo nano /etc/postfix/generic
and add this two lines



root@localdomain user@domain.com
@localdomain user@domain.com
substitute user@domain.com with your Office365 account used previously. Now lets set correct file permissions and hash the file for use in postfix.



sudo chown root:root /etc/postfix/generic
sudo chmod 0600 /etc/postfix/generic
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/generic
Our configuration is done. Lets restart postfix and test.



sudo service postfix restart
echo ""This is a test body"" | mail -s ""Relay Test Email"" user@publicdomain -a ""FROM:user@domain.com""
If you did not receive the test email then check the log files at /var/log/mail.log

Common problems
If you you are trying to send an email from user@domain.com to other user in the same @domain.com domain and in the main.cf file for the mydestination setting you have added domain.com then the email will not be sent because postfix thinks this is a local relay. Try removing domain.com from the mydestination setting."
How to use async function in python,IT_Helpdesk,"Following example shows that when function A() is executed, function B() is also executed!



def functionA():

If we want to use async for functionB() we need to do the following

To use async function, we have to import following module:



from zappa.async import task
use @TASK before the start of function:

Activate virtualenv in Fish shell,IT_Helpdesk,"If you used to be a bash shell user and then decided to move to fish, you will probably face a problem with activating your python virtual environment.

Semi-Attended Transfer: Transfer a call when receiving the ring-back.

Attended Transfer : Transfer a call with prior consulting.

However, we believe that Attended Transfer is the most appropriate for our university.

It requires little in the way of persuasion to convince, well, anyone, that passwords are unpleasant: they’re difficult to type, harder to remember, and, sadly, they offer only diminishing security for our personal and private information. Yet for the time being passwords remain our primary means of verifying the identity of individuals before granting access to services or data. This document details some upcoming changes to how APIIT Education Group maintains digital credentials and discusses some planned future enhancements.

It is worth briefly discussing what passwords do. Passwords don’t intrinsically provide any security; rather, a password is a secret that (in theory) is known only to an individual. By providing the password when prompted, you as an individual are identified; that is, the combination of the username and password tells the system who you are—and because the password is a secret known only to you, it verifies that you are who you say you are.

Creating Strong Passwords

A strong password has usually meant one that is difficult to guess. Yet with the advent of powerful computing, it has become possible to make repeated guesses at a password, thousands if not millions of times per minute.1 The effect of this is that an ordinary 8-character password, by itself, offers limited protection against hacking. The standard approach to addressing this is to require passwords of greater and greater complexity and length—thus leading to more forgotten or mistyped passwords, an increased burden on helpdesks, and user frustration and anger.

Why Bother?

First, passwords do get stolen, and they get stolen in a number of different ways. Additionally, we regularly see brute force2 attempts to log into an account using commonly used passwords. By requiring the use of strong passwords, we are attempting to slow the ability to use the stolen password long enough for us to detect its use, detect its theft, or lower our attractiveness as a target.3

Achieving this does not require absurdly complex passwords, but it does require the use of longer passwords or passphrases. For example, using a well-known method for evaluating passwords,4 we see that the apparently very strong password &xy90UJ! would take ~7 years to crack; whereas the much easier to remember passphrase rain Spain falls plain would take centuries to crack. Here are a few more samples in this table:


Since it is obvious that long, comprehensible, and memorable sentences make for much stronger credentials than traditional passwords, it is compelling to ask, “why are we still using traditional passwords?” The answer is historical more than technical. Because of the long use of passwords, many applications assume that the password “ends” when it encounters the first space character. Thus “Rosebud Was The Sled” will be seen as merely “Rosebud,” a word found in dictionaries and instantly crackable.

It’s also reasonable to ask why, if a password can resist being cracked for a century, it would ever need to be changed. First, note that those estimates for crack time make a number of assumptions about how the password is stored. If you use the same password at APIIT Education Group that you use for a poorly secured website or game site, the thief may be able to simply read your password—no cracking necessary.  Thus it becomes a balancing act—we require you to change your password periodically based on a reasonable estimate of how long it might take to crack it. While it would be possible to calculate a unique password expiration period for everyone, supporting this (and explaining it) can get complicated. Therefore, our policy will be to require annual password changes for shorter passwords, and biennial changes (every two years) for longer passwords and passphrases.

Second, despite being a violation of policy and best practice, we know from experience that people do occasionally share a password. By periodically requiring the password to change, we effectively reset that decision.

Ultimately, passwords are like stoves, to quote Mark Twain:

We do not remember the exact date of the invention of stoves, but it was some years ago. Since then mankind have been tormented once a year, by the difficulties that beset the task of putting them up, and getting the pipes fixed.5

Going Forward: Password and Passphrase Creation and Maintenance

In summary, LTS is modifying the rules for creating and changing passwords and passphrases. These changes are designed to encourage longer and easier-to-remember passphrases. This represents a significant increase to the protection of campus accounts, systems, and services.

Passphrases are over 14 characters in length and may be formed using only upper- and lowercase characters (a minimum of one of each). These will expire after a period of two years. For technical reasons, no passphrase may be over 30 characters in length. We recommend using a minimum of four unrelated words separated by spaces.

Passwords must be between 10 and 14 characters. Passwords 14 characters or fewer in length will require the usual assortment of at least one character from each character set: digits (0-9), non-alphabetic symbols (!@#$%); uppercase letters (A-Z), and lowercase letters (a-z). Dictionary words and commonly used passwords are also not permitted to be part of the password.

In no case may the user’s username or last password be part of either a password or a passphrase.

The following table summarizes the above rule set.

Changing your password

One of the largest problems facing institutions that require a periodic password change is assisting individuals who have forgotten their passwords. After all, in order to change your password you need to log in. In order to minimize this burden (to both the community and the LTS Help Desk), we have recently introduced a new method for self-service password reset for individuals who do not know their passwords.


If you fail to change your password and your account is locked, you may unlock your account two ways:

API User Authentication using CAS,IT_Helpdesk,"CAS Sequence

 

REST Protocol
The REST protocol allows one to model applications as users, programmatically acquiring service tickets to authenticate to other applications. This means that other applications would be able to use a CAS client to accept Service Tickets rather than to rely upon another technology such as client SSL certificates for application-to-application authentication of requests. This is achieved by exposing a way to RESTfully obtain a Ticket Granting Ticket and then use that to obtain a Service Ticket.

Request a Ticket Granting Ticket (Step 1)


POST https://cas.apiit.edu.my/cas/v1/tickets HTTP/1.0
'Content-type': 'Application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
username=battags&password=password&additionalParam1=paramvalue
CAS REST Protocol step 1
Successful Response


201 Created
Location: http://www.whatever.com/cas/v1/tickets/{TGT id}
Unsuccessful Response
If incorrect credentials are sent, CAS will respond with a 400 Bad Request error (will also respond for missing parameters, etc.). If you send a media type it does not understand, it will send the 415 Unsupported Media Type.

Request For a Service Ticket (Step 02)
The below snippets show one might request a service ticket using the semantics of the CAS protocol:



POST /cas/v1/tickets/{TGT id} HTTP/1.0

service={form encoded parameter for the service url}
Successful Response


200 OK
ST-1-FFDFHDSJKHSDFJKSDHFJKRUEYREWUIFSD2132

 

Validate Service Ticket (Step 03)
Service ticket validation is handled through the CAS Protocol via any of the validation endpoints such as/p3/serviceValidate.



GET /cas/p3/serviceValidate?service={service url}&ticket={service ticket}
Sample XML output on successful ticket validation:

Development Practices for APU APPS,IT_Helpdesk,"1. Programming Language

Back-end: Python 3.6/Python 3.7/Python 3.8/ Python 3.9

To use the higher versions of the Python it is necessary to ensure Zappa and Lambda both are supporting it.

Framework: Flask (*preferred), Chalice

Front-end: Angular, Ionic, Electron  

Note 1: if you are working on a project with a team of developers you must have a requirement file in your repository.

Note 2: For database manipulation, you are highly recommended to use SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper for the Python programming language. It allows you to write Python code in your project to map from the database schema to the applications’ Python objects. No SQL is required to create, maintain and query the database. SQLAlchemy is an implementation of the object-relational mapping (ORM) concept.

 

 

2. IDE / Editor
Note: If you are using the same editor / IDE within the team you can push the editor / IDE configurations and setting to the repository so that all your team members have the same experience.

Sublime Text

VSCode

Vim

Emacs

PyCharm

3. Coding Guidelines
Python:
You must include the requirements.txt with library’s particular version in the project. Reference: Requirements files Google Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

4. Source Code Repository
The source code repository must be hosted on BitBucket

5. Authentication / Authorization
Authentication
All authentications must be in a stateless manner. Do NOT use sessions. To use CAS for authentication use CAS file in the development tools project hosted here: Bitbucket  To understand how CAS authentication works, you may refer to CAS Sequence diagram

Authorization
To authorize the users you can create a group in active directory and rely on CAS response XML, which then contains memberOf.

6. Testing
  For API testing refer to http://kb.sites.apiit.edu.my/knowledge-base/api-documentation/

7. Build / Deployment
 

What is pipeline?
Integrated CI/CD for Bitbucket Cloud that’s trivial to set up, automating your code from test to production. Easy setup and configuration There are no CI servers to set up, user management to configure, or repos to synchronize. Just enable Pipelines with a few simple clicks and you’re ready to go. A unified experience with Bitbucket Stop jumping between multiple applications. Manage your entire development workflow within Bitbucket, from code to deployment. Automate dev to deployment Sufficient coverage gives you the confidence to deploy. Reduce human error and keep the team lean working on critical tasks. Support for every platform Build and test with any language or platform including Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, .NET Code and more. Configuration as code Store and manage your build configurations in a single bitbucket-pipelines.yml file. Only 7 lines of code to get you started. Map the branch structure Pipelines can be aligned with the branch structure, making it easier to work with branching workflows like feature branching or git-flow.

What is Zappa and why using it?
Zappa makes it super easy to build and deploy serverless, event-driven Python applications (including, but not limited to, WSGI web apps) on AWS Lambda + API Gateway. Think of it as “serverless” web hosting for your Python apps. That means infinite scaling, zero downtime, zero maintenance – and at a fraction of the cost of your current deployments! If you’ve got a Python web app (including Django and Flask apps), it’s as easy as:



$ pip install zappa
$ zappa init
$ zappa deploy
and now you’re server-less! Wow!

What do you mean “serverless”?

Okay, so there still is a server – but it only has a 40-millisecond life cycle! Serverless in this case means “without any permanent infrastructure.” With a traditional HTTP server, the server is online 24/7, processing requests one by one as they come in. If the queue of incoming requests grows too large, some requests will time out. With Zappa, each request is given its own virtual HTTP “server” by Amazon API Gateway. AWS handles the horizontal scaling automatically, so no requests ever time out. Each request then calls your application from a memory cache in AWS Lambda and returns the response via Python’s WSGI interface. After your app returns, the “server” dies. Better still, with Zappa you only pay for the milliseconds of server time that you use, so it’s many orders of magnitude cheaper than VPS/PaaS hosts like Linode or Heroku – and in most cases, it’s completely free. Plus, there’s no need to worry about load balancing or keeping servers online ever again. It’s great for deploying serverless microservices with frameworks like Flask and Bottle, and for hosting larger web apps and CMSes with Django. Or, you can use any WSGI-compatible app you like! You probably don’t need to change your existing applications to use it, and you’re not locked into using it. Zappa also lets you build hybrid event-driven applications that can scale to trillions of events a year with no additional effort on your part! You also get free SSL certificates, global app deployment, API access management, automatic security policy generation, precompiled C-extensions, auto keep-warms, oversized Lambda packages, and many other exclusive features! And finally, Zappa is super easy to use. You can deploy your application with a single command out of the box! Awesome! To use Zappa in BitBucket pipeline you need to have a file named zappa_settings.json in the root of the repository.

The deployment is in AWS environemnt (most probably) as so you need to have the networking settings in the zappa file. That includes subnet ID and security group. You MUST request a new security group for each project. This is necessary as the other security groups attached to database or EC2 or other resources are relying on security group ID. For each new zappa deployment you MUST request a new AWS S3 bucket and define a rational project name.

"Manually Submit Messages to Microsoft for Analysis
",IT_Helpdesk,"Information security is everyone's responsibility!
 


If you receive a message that passed through spam filtering that should have been identified as spam/junk or phishing, you can submit the message to the Microsoft Spam Analysis and Microsoft Phishing Analysis teams as appropriate. The analysts will review the message and add it to the service-wide filters if it meets the classification criteria:

 

Create a new, blank email message with one of the following recipients:

If a junk/spam email: junk@office365.microsoft.com

If a phishing email: phish@office365.microsoft.com

 

2. Drag and drop the junk or phishing message into the new message. This will save the junk or phishing message as an attachment in the new message. Don't copy and paste the content of the message or forward the message (Microsoft  needs the original message so they can inspect the message header)

You can attach multiple messages in the new message. Make sure that all the messages are the same type: either phishing scam messages or junk email messages.

Leave the body of the new message empty.

Use either .msg (default Outlook format) or .eml (default Outlook on the Web format) formats for the attached messages.

 3. When you're finished, click Send.

Phishing Awareness,IT_Helpdesk,"Phishing is the most common type of cyber-attack that affects organizations like ours. Phishing attacks can take many forms, but they all share a common goal – getting you to share sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card information, or bank account details. Although we maintain controls to help protect our networks and computers from cyber threats, we rely on you to be our first line of defence. We’ve outlined a few different types of phishing attacks to watch out for:

Phishing: In this type of attack, hackers impersonate a real company to obtain your login credentials. You may receive an e-mail asking you to verify your account details with a link that takes you to an imposter login screen that delivers your information directly to the attackers.

Spear Phishing: Spear phishing is a more sophisticated phishing attack that includes customized information that makes the attacker seem like a legitimate source. They may use your name and phone number and refer to APU  in the e-mail to trick you into thinking they have a connection to you, making you more likely to click a link or attachment that they provide.

Whaling: Whaling is a popular ploy aimed at getting you to transfer money or send sensitive information to an attacker via email by impersonating a real university staff. Using a fake domain that appears similar to ours, they look like normal emails from a high-level official of the company, typically the Head of School or your lecturer, and ask you for sensitive information (including usernames and passwords).

Shared Document Phishing: You may receive an e-mail that appears to come from file-sharing site like SharePoint alerting you that a document has been shared with you. The link provided in these e-mails will take you to a fake login page that mimics the real login page and will steal your account credentials.

 

What You Can Do
 To avoid these phishing schemes, please observe the following email best practices:

Do not click on links or attachments from senders that you do not recognize. Be especially wary of .zip or other compressed or executable file types.

Do not provide sensitive personal information (like usernames and passwords) over email.

Watch for email senders that use suspicious or misleading domain names.

Inspect URLs carefully to make sure they’re legitimate and not imposter sites.

Do not try to open any shared document that you’re not expecting to receive.

If you can’t tell if an email is legitimate or not, please  send email to asssit@apu.edu.my to allow us to verify.

Be especially cautious when opening attachments or clicking links if you receive an email containing a warning banner indicating that it originated from an external source."
