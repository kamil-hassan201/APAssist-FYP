The focus will not be on teaching \nall of the details of programming under specific platforms, but rather on providing both a high-level \nunderstanding and practical implementation experience of reusable algorithms and coding \ntechniques that apply to the development of applications across different platforms and genres.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17cf29b0-a8c0-4bd8-93d1-232474486236": {"__data__": {"id_": "17cf29b0-a8c0-4bd8-93d1-232474486236", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Assignment - Group - IPPR - 2305 Intake.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c01d3d1-bb58-4727-9ef9-f1834fd42bb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Assignment - Group - IPPR - 2305 Intake.pdf"}, "hash": "125c878bfcfd3cd865651014eb6b191ef455e4f1c7344277a9746356dede7613"}}, "hash": "f04a41982b16ec891de692a969412400d8376189bac3893b4bb087953c53d30c", "text": "Image Processing, Comp.

As a result, the issue of \nefficiently distinguishing genuine from counterfeit banknotes using automated machines has \nbecome increasingly important. Almost every country has a problem with counterfeit notes. There \nis a need to design a system that will aid in the efficient recognition of paper currency notes. In this \nassignment, the student is required to explore the domain to gain an understanding on what are all \nthe candidate techniques/methods widely being used in image processing bound fake currency \ndetection systems.  \n \nFigure 1: Fake currency detection", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e995c53-4c52-4dd3-9b01-d1ee0d2dcfe9": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e995c53-4c52-4dd3-9b01-d1ee0d2dcfe9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Assignment - Group - IPPR - 2305 Intake.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30bcf892-3167-4d33-8c8b-302989d523e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Assignment - Group - IPPR - 2305 Intake.pdf"}, "hash": "aed0c6fe4c3a701804b58e530b0891762f05a815e6ee3d412f4e87766336156c"}}, "hash": "717609544cae42a775937bc22bdd5506ea45635283d0696e8ca295c240bef0d4", "text": "Image Processing, Comp.

Provide \njustification for the choices made, including in any libraries and data used. You will need to design \nand implement a fake currency detection (FKD) system, and then test the system to evaluate the \naccuracy of the proposed techniques.

Students will also be assessed \nindividually on their contributions to the assignment.  \n\uf0b7 Fake currency identification/detection must be done with atleast 3 types of features (one for \nevery group member).  \n\uf0b7 A GUI has to be developed, and the system must be updated to show the types of features \ntowards fake detection. \n\uf0b7 The system must not be sensitive to environmental changes ( Haar Cascade, Tensorflow \nand pattern matching methods should not be used) .  \n \n5.0 DELIVERABLES: \nIn addition, a supporting document is to be produced to reflect on the methodologies and \nimplementation tasks applied in the development of the application.
